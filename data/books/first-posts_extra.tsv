8ntefm	book	extra	reddit	[TOMT][BOOK] Fantasy book I read ages ago. Hey! Ok so this is really far fetched since I barely remember anything and what I do remember sounds like a typical fantasy story but I thought what the hell I might as well try finding it again.. So what I think I remember: It should be a part of a series, should be fantasy but maybe post apocalyptic? I remember there being a main girl and main boy characters who she either meets or they are sibilings? I think there is this big desert, aaaaaand something about Amber? OH and maybe some sort of Wind Instrument.. or has to do with some Wind maybe? (But not Name of the Wind..) Oh and the cover or something in the book is maybe about a sculpt? something sculpted out of wind and sand maybe? The beginning might involve some big machine or something carrying one of the characters to this big city? Maybe with a lot of other kids? She might also be an orphan (and the boy, if he is her brother). That's all I can remember.. man it was like 10 years ago it popped up in my head all of a sudden but I remember nothing about it except all this very muddy memories!

8o6u7h	book	extra	reddit	[TOMT] 90s children’s sea creature book. I’m trying to remember the title of a children’s book my sister and I had growing up (I was born in 1991 and probably had the book in the mid to late 90s). I really can’t remember the premise of the book but it had a darkish blue cover with fancy sea creatures dressed in nice clothes. I think they may have lived on a submarine. There was a crab/lobster that wore a nice suit. Kicking myself because I actually saw a copy of this book at a thrift store a few months ago. I freaked out and almost bought it, then put it back. And it’s not at the thrift store anymore of course!

8o92fe	book	extra	reddit	[TOMT] [BOOK] Kids book about plants in their neighbour's backyard?. There's this book I read as a kid, it was about a neighbour who grew these really tall make-believe red plants. They were kind of like a tomato/flower/fruit thing? They built this crazy garden/fort thing out of them, ate them, and even played sports with them. The main kid's family only grew the three sisters (corn, beans, and squash), so he was really intrigued by the neighbour's yard. The neighbour's yard was fantastical and they used this plant for everything and were super inventive with it. I know that's not much of an explanation, but that's all I remember. I absolutely adored it when I was a child and I've been trying really hard to figure out what book it was! If anyone could help that would be great. I'm pretty sure it was through Scholastic in Canada, it would have been between 2000 and 2004 or so.
8oaobh	book	extra	reddit	[TOMT] [Book] Small man/mouse gets drunk on dandelion brew?. It was a book I read in grade school - a mouse sized man or a mouse-man (can't remember which) gets lost and has to survive in the wilderness which triggers a revelatory Walden-esque appreciation for the natural world and 'real' accomplishments as opposed to the illusory ones conjured up by society. I remember he made some dandelion wine (or maybe mead) that showed up several times in the story which struck me as very unusual. As far as the diction goes I remember it feeling definitely antiquated, almost certainly from before the mid 20th century. Anyone know what I'm talking about? I'd love to re-read it and get to know it better.

8odnjd	book	extra	reddit	[TOMT][Book] Books about young kids at a vet clinic helping animals.. Hello, my memory has suddenly failed me. As a kid, probably around age 8-10, I would read little novels about kids taking care of animals at a vet clinic. There were a few in this anthology series (though i think it was the same clinic), each boom focused on a different kid. My favorite was about a blonde girl (her picture was on the back cover) and a puppy, I think. My most vivid memory from them is the blonde girl saying she doesn’t look good in purple, but on the back cover she’s wearing purple. And at one point a dog threw up and a kid said “Eww.” written exactly like that. I know those details aren’t exactly helpful but my childhood is slipping away if i can’t find these books!

They rigged up some contraption to capture water? If I am combining stories and anyone knows the other title, that one has been churning in my head too. I think they were stories read in school...
8of4ch	book	extra	reddit	[TOMT][Book] Sci-fi(?) book about a group of children/teens fighting against aliens. Title of book was the protagonist's role in his group.. I'm looking for a book that I read 5+ years ago. It was about a young boy, probably a teen, who meets and joins a group of other children/teens trying to kill off the aliens. Every member of the group has a role, and the title of the book was the main character's role. I'm pretty sure it started with an S. Maybe something like Seeker? The main thing I remember is that one of the group members, possibly the leader, used something like a gun to fight. When the aliens were shot, they would turn into little balls of light that would float up. Towards the end of the book, the kids were able to find the aliens' breeding grounds and were planning to blow it up to get rid of them once and for all. That's when we find out that every time an alien was shot, each of those little balls of light would then turn into another alien. So the entire time these kids have been fighting, they've actually only been making their situation worse.
8of7iz	book	extra	reddit	[TOMT][BOOK]a girl living in a city who loves clubbing and dresses she speaks to her clothing and opens a club in her apartment. Read it about 10 years ago. I think the main character lives somewhere like NYC. She names her dresses and outfits and talks to them like they are real people. I think she has a thing where if she wears an outfit she becomes a different person as well. Her clothes are all described as kind of out there, like a neon green latex dress and feather boa (and she might name that outfit 'Alexa' or something) She opens an 'exclusive' nightclub in her crappy tiny apartment. My friend borrowed it years ago and never gave it back. I think the cover was hot pink and yellow. Please help! It's been driving me mad. Googling around the keywords girl, outfit, dress, nightclub don't really help!! ETA: it isn't the Secret Lives of Dresses

Google keeps showing me Still Life with Oysters and Lemon which is absolutely not it.

The girl asks her mom if they can have one for her brother.
8olj2a	book	extra	reddit	[TOMT] [Book] Children’s book series with one of them having a title something like “the sorcerer’s apprentice”. I’ve been googling, and haven’t found any books that start with “the sorcerer’s” so I’m thinking maybe it was another word like wizard but I haven’t found anything yet. I read the second or third book in this series when I was around 8 (2003/2004ish). It was about a boy who had started learning about magic and stuff from some kind of sorcerer/wizard, and was set a few centuries ago. There was no electricity and characters were poor. In this time, there were witches who were persecuted by “normal” people. People could tell who the witches were because they all wore pointed shoes. The boy had a friend who was a witch, and I think her name was Alice. All of the books were named “the sorcerer’s/wizard’s/something’s _____” and was written showing the boy’s experiences. I think it was written in third person. The cover of the particular book I read was navy blue, with the title and some kind of simple drawing in gold foil. Each of the books were different colours (red and green are colours I distinctly remember). The texture was kind of bubbly/rough, I’m not sure how to describe it but I really enjoyed the feel of it because it wasn’t smooth like most books. I’m in the UK so I’m not sure if it was a book just released here, or if it was available in the US too.
8omr63	book	extra	reddit	[TOMT]Looking for the worst, most convoluted book I ever read. Okay, I have no idea when it came out or who wrote it. All I remember is that some kids get a message on a ouija board and end up going on a camping trip where they get attacked by a naked bodybuilder wielding a machete, and when they finally get away from him they are attacked by a roving gang of incestuous rapist/pedophiles who turn out to be one of the main character's family. Yup. Makes perfect sense.
8on0ao	book	extra	reddit	[TOMT][Novel] The name of a book that an anime/novel is partly based-off of. There's an anime/novel called [[Shin Sekai Yori]] (From the New World) which takes place in a post apocalyptic world where modern city has long collapsed because of nuclear weapons and is slowly being rebuilt. I remember reading somewhere that large parts of the book are inspired by an american novel, however the name of it escapes me. All I can remember is that it's similar in the sense that it's post-apocalyptic and deals with the fall of society. It's not Alas Babylon (it takes place at least decades after the use of nuclear weapons). I remember the cover having a man with his back turned to the viewer sitting down looking over a field.

I could’ve swore it was called “Point Break” or something but no matter what I google I cannot find the image or anything. Vaguely remember it being about a spy or something but could be 100% wrong.

8oxaue	book	extra	reddit	[TOMT] [BOOK] Old children’s book with yellow hippo like weird creatures that may have lived underground. I remember the book being like a large rectangle and it was just about the lives of these weird creatures. It was kind of dark and I remember one page was them in battle armor. I can’t remember what exactly they looked like but I think the had rounded faces like a hippo. It was a rather long book and showed the different layers of their lives. I keep thinking they were kind of gnomeish and may have lived underground or they did stuff underground but i also remember some kind of castle? I feel crazy but I know it was a real book!
8oxisv	book	extra	reddit	[TOMT][Book] A book I read when I was young. The book is about this kid who’s an outcast. You can infer when you read that he has some learning disability or something. One part in the book I remember well is that his last name started with a Z. I believe his first name started with a Z as well. His name may have been the title of the book, but my memory is foggy so don’t count on it. So in grade school, he had a nice teacher who when they placed them in alphabetical order, they said, “The Z shall be first!” And another year in grade school he had a mean teacher who said “The Z shall be last!” Every time they were lined up in alphabetical order. At one point, some kid goes missing so the outcast kid goes looking for him in the cold and gets all delirious because he was out there for hours. He has a bunch of flashbacks throughout his life. When the police found him, I believe he was passed out, they told him that they had found the missing kid hours ago, and had been looking for him the whole time. That’s all I remember. I really hope I can find this book again, because I remember it really hit me in the feels.

8ozg1w	book	extra	reddit	[TOMT][BOOK] Childrens Book from the early 1930's involving a wooden rocking horse that comes to life. Not too many details that can be remembered here but here goes: * The book is a children's book that my girlfriend's mother used to read to her when she was little. * She believes the book was written in the 1930's, but this may be out by a few years (or even decades). * The story centres around a wooden rocking horse that comes to life slowly over a period of time. * The book contained occasional ink drawings through its pages. In particular my girlfriend remembers a vivid image of the rocking horse being left in an attic for a long time. * The rocking horse/horse has its own adventures when it is separated from its owner. After many years the two are reunited and the owner, now old, fondly remembers the horse and welcomes it back. The book was a library book but neither my girlfriend or her mum can remember the name of it. Thanks in advance.
8ozgds	book	extra	reddit	[TOMT][BOOK] A book that was required reading in my sophomore year of high school (2007). I don't remember the author of the book or anything\- not even the characters' names\- but there is one particular moment in the book that's stayed with me to this point: The friend of the main character (who is the focus of the book, and I think might be the antagonist?) is forcing him to run on the track at their school, and pushes him to continue running past the point where he wants to stop. I just remember the character describing the feeling of entering what was essentially runner's high, and that's about it. I'm looking for it again particularly because I want to read it over again. I can remember most of the other books I read from that year except for this one. Thanks in advance!

8p0g8b	book	extra	reddit	[TOMT][BOOK] Story similar to Mortal Engines I can't recall the name of.. So I Just saw the Trailer to Mortal Engines on YouTube and thought to myself. ""I've read this story before back in middle school I think"". But the trailer didn't match my memory so I googled mortal engines and found it wasn't the series I recalled. its been many years (I read this in middle school between 2009-2011) but im pretty sure it was a young adult book. It might have even been a short series but I don't recall. The Story took place in giant machines that traveled the earth and people lived on them. But they weren't moving cities like in the trailer. The Story takes place in the UK's Version of these giant machines because each country had their own. And the nobles lived in the upper levels of these giant machines and the engineers/workers live near the bottom in slums and are treated poorly. And the giant machines are shown to destroy nature and even villages that get in their path as they travel the world but no one seems to notice or care I think in the story a girl from the lower deck meets a boy in the upper levels who is like the son a noble. They somehow Travel together throughout the story and fall in love like most other young adult books. And in the end they expose the leader/captain of the giant machine as corrupt, the boy I think became the new captain and convinces the other huge machines to drive in the ocean to protect the nature and villages from their giant wheels/treads (even though that probably would still damage nature) and the workers don't have to live in the slums/engine rooms anymore. Does anyone know of a book series like this?

The main characters were this pagan Viking boy and this catholic girl that they had captured on one of their raids and I believe the girl tries to convert the boy.

8p6aa9	book	extra	reddit	[TOMT][BOOK] Short stories book for young adults. I'll try my best to describe this. Apologies in advance if it's not the best explanation. When I was in middle school, one of our teachers read to us from this sort of mystery book that was all about lateral thinking. The book had a whole bunch of short stories where one character would recount a personal experience and it was the reader's job to find an inaccuracy in this story. Kind of like the book version of Phoenix Wright if that helps. The one example I remember is there was a story (I think it was a murder mystery) about a person in Louisiana in the winter. They tell their story in front of a judge, and after thinking it over, the judge has an ""a ha"" moment and pronounces them guilty. The inaccuracy in the story was that the person described Louisiana as having a lot of mosquitoes when they were there, but Louisiana actually has no mosquitoes in the winter (or something to that end). Now that I'm a teacher, I've been doing a lot of lateral thinking stuff with my students. So even if you don't know the exact book, I'd love any recommendations for books with lateral thinking puzzles. Thanks! :)

It took place in a city where all the poor lived on the surface level and the rich lived up above in a city built on top of it. I think the city had walls built around it and they told the public that it was an inhospitable wasteland. A bunch of kids were selected for some sort of rigorous training/tournament. It’s revealed that the outside isn’t a wasteland but a paradise inhabited by the extremely rich and powerful and the upperclass in the city wanted to wage war on them. Also there might have been big robot animal security death machines. I’m sorry I don’t remember anything else, any help is appreciated.
8pga2v	book	extra	reddit	[TOMT][BOOK] mid 2005 book about fairy’s.. I remember getting it for Christmas around 2004-2006. It was a large book, hard copy, very thin, and purple. It had very beautifully illustrated pictures of fairy’s. It wasn’t cartoony it was very detailed with flowers and fairies, woodland creatures. They all wore very elegant robes and jewelry . It was targeted towards kids though. Maybe about 7-8 different stories all in the one book. One story I kind of remember was about a unicorn family and a fairy princess castle. ( very vague I know- like every fairy book) One story had a fairy ring and the girl went into the forest to get berries? And stumbled upon a fairy ring, and she saw all the small fairy’s in the woods. Ugh trying to think about it because I would love to read the book to my younger sister.

8phfgq	book	extra	reddit	[TOMT][book] Children's book centered around fairies, with a lot of NOT THE BEES!. This was a fantasy book I read in the mid-'90s. It was aimed at maybe 4th- to 6th-graders. I think the main characters were a group of siblings. * Takes place in a modern-day city, probably London. * The main family has a child who was ""touched by magic"" somehow and born with a few special, blue hairs that carry some kind of one-use miraculous power. One of them is used to heal a leg injury overnight. * There are a lot of fairies (or another kind of miniature, intelligent people?) involved in the main plot. * The fairies hate and fear wasps. One of the friendly ones mentions knowing where the big hives are around the city, with words to the effect of: ""If there were deadly tigers running loose, wouldn't you soon know where they lived?"" * The antagonist is an evil fairy who somehow controls/befriends the wasps, even sitting on a throne made of wasps.

At the end of the book he has to fight a spy named Jack? There is a quote about you can be Jack of all trades but master of none during the fight. I remember that the book starts with the boy's parents dying and him crawling somewhere. Any help will be appreciated! (typed this out on mobile so just tell me if there is anything I need to fix!)

8pqi1w	book	extra	reddit	[TOMT][BOOK] Children’s Book about animals trying to get the sun to come out. 70’s-80’s - not called Wake Up Sun.. I used to have a book when I was a child, wider than it was high. It was about animals trying to get the sun to come out. I recently did a search and found Wake Up Sun. I know this is not the right book because in the other book, it was not about farm animals but a bunch of animals. Forest animals. I specifically remember the animals some how getting above the clouds, knocking on the sun’s door and asking him to come out. The sun was not feeling well but the animals helped the sun feel better. I also remember a porcupine being used as a scrub brush to make the sun shine again. Any ideas?
8pt6er	book	extra	reddit	[TOMT][Book]Saw a post in which someone asked about a dinosaur book, thought I knew it, then realized I had no idea what the title of the book *I* was thinking of is.. So in r/books this guy was asking about a sci-fi dinosaur book that actually sounds pretty cool. But anyway. I thought I knew the book he was describing, read further, realized I was wrong. Then I had the second realization that I didn't remember the title of the book I was thinking of. ...so. Now that I've just repeated the title of my post unnecessarily, let's move on. The book I'm struggling with featured tribal, cave men humans who either coexist with humanoid dinosaurs or live under their semi-distant yoke. The main character has a ...cleft pallet? Hair lip? His eventual human girlfriend is named Squirrel. He meets her in this slave camp or something, before he becomes the personal servant/body slave of one of the dinosaur females because she (the dinosaur) realizes that she caught him in a lie and is fascinated, because the dinosaurs communicate through body language (or pheromones maybe) as well as speech and lying is impossible for them. Also the dinosaur people have two opposable thumbs.

There was one chapter in particular where Mabel and her friend get to wear hoop skirts for the first time, think they’re pretty hot stuff, then go to sit down in church and their hoop skirts fly up, revealing their knickers. I read the book in the late 90s-early 2000s. Does this sound familiar to anyone else? Does anyone know the name of this book?

I remember around 2005-2006 my teacher reading a book about a girl who had a plush rabbit, and the book was from the rabbits perspective I think. Here's the story: In the beginning of the book, a little girl brings her plush rabbit on a boat/cruise. Some older boys take her plush rabbit and start tossing it around to each other, and one of them accidentally throws it over the edge of the boat. The rabbit gets tangled up on a fishermans hook and he brings it out of the water. The fisherman gives the plush to his son (?) and then he gives it to his little sister, who's really sick and coughing up blood. I don't remember what happens next, but the plush rabbit eventually ends up at an antique store. The girl who originally owned the plush is an adult now. She walks into the store, is shocked to find her old plush rabbit and buys it. And that's the end of the book

8qaw3n	book	extra	reddit	[TOMT][BOOK]Sci-Fi/Fantasy/Dystopian Virtual War over non-irradiated island. Hi everyone! I just remembered reading a book when I was younger and I can't for the life of me remember what it or any of its subsequent books were called. Here's what I remember of the plot: There is a virtual war going on between 2 world super powers as a way to settle the ownership of a newly discovered island. Most of the world is irradiated due to a nuclear war that forced everyone to live in climate controlled domes. The new island is discovered to be the first place on Earth to be free of radiation since the bombs fell. So, the nations raise their team of 2 champions from birth to play this virtual game. The main protagonist is a boy that is raised by an AI that serves as his parental figure and teaches him everything he knows about the world. The other member of his team is a girl who rejects the brainwashing of the AI and is kind of a rebel. They work together but lose to the other team but it turns out that they cheated so the protagonists win the island. Their reward is to live on the island and that is how the first book ends. I remember some of the other plot for the second? or third? book as well if that would help. This wasn't too recent maybe before 2013? More like 2008-2012 was when I read it and it was fairly new then.

8qtm73	book	extra	reddit	[TOMT] [Book] looking for book title and author please.. Okay so for the life of me I can't remember this book or its author and the character names are slipping my mind as well but I remember the synopsis. Maybe by describing it it'll trigger someone on here as this has haunted me for close to 2 years now to no avail. The book is about 2 brothers who own a failing fire wood company in New Mexico up in the mountainous region of the state. One is a former marine who lost his leg below the knee the younger brother is a young hot head with big dreams of grandiose. The older former marine brother has a girlfriend who is the daughter of the local sheriff in town. The sheriff is a coke addict to the extreme with a deputy who is some bum he can manipulate to his desires as well. I believe he drove around in a cop car with the American flag on all over it very distinguishable. The sheriff was corrupt and worked for a cartel drug leader located in New Mexico. The cattle drug lord was a gay dancer that had an affinity for recreating scenes from famous plays and ballets with other dancers in his spare time as well as having his guards parading around in nothing but their skivy's and see thru material. The 2 brothers stumbled apon a outdoor grow operation and the younger brother kills the gay drug lords nephew who was watching the crop up in the mountains and they steal the crop which leads to the unfolding of a great series of events to jumps to a great conclusion to the story. If any of this rings a bell please help end my quest and satisfy my hunger to re-read this great story. Edit: solved thanks again
8qv0hc	book	extra	reddit	[TOMT][children's book] Horror fiction novel akin to goosebumps that had a goblin theme(Obviously more inside). Like the title says, this book was a children's book, more specifically a horror children's novel that was around the same shape (physically) as R.L Stine's goosebumps books and if I remember started off very casual. I had it as a child and remember reading the beginning but never really getting into it. Friends at school or something like that.... I know it did have a storyline of like something happening at the school meanwhile these goblins were intruding into the world, a school dance I want to say, but I'm not entirely sure of the specificity of that. But I don't remember the book for the story. The cover is what stayed with me after all these years of just having it in my memory. This is all coming from memory so I might be wrong, but I'll give it my best shot. The cover didn't use a lot of colors but it showed a forest, you couldn't see much of it (the author might've used yellow? to depict fog), but there were numerous trees here and there. I don't know if they all had the same thing happening but the most prominent tree (it might've been a bit off center) had a goblin's arm or head for that matter (now this was a bright but creepyish green) coming out of the tree hollow. Now that I think about all the trees had hollows in their centers. It was a very creepy cover for such a lighthearted book (well, that's being compared to what I read anyways.) I could swear the name of the book was something like goblins in the woods or goblins in the trees or something that pertained to what we were seeing on the cover. Oh and if it helps, this book could've been released anyway from late 90's to 2002,2003,2004ish? The cover of the book that I'm trying to find sort of does the same cover of this book: https://images.gr-assets.com/books/1347224970l/5185742.jpg - specifically the colors behind the goblin in that the colors used for the trees are darker than the colors used for the air around them. I've been doing a search for it on Google myself the last couple of days and haven't found anything myself, that's why I'm here.

It was possibly even blue. Thank you so much in advance!!! \*Edit: maybe it was 7\-9 dogs and maybe the dog that won wasn't named Blu, but I remember the dog that won won because he saved so many people from a natural disaster. Also, each chapter of the book was about a different dog's story. All of the dogs in the books were contestants for this award.

This is a book most likely from the past 10 years that I checked out from my high school library. Everything I remember about it: The (probably teenage) boy lives in a rural area with his father who I think is abusive to him. A meteorite lands in a nearby field and after this the boy begins to see three of his childhood toys come to life. They are large and unsettling and can somehow communicate with the boy. In the end I believe they help the boy kill his father or inspire him to do so, in a graphically described scene. I also remember a scene involving finding blood spilled in a cornfield. I think the book had a mostly black cover and had a one-word title. I have no idea who the author was but I remember the book cover having a review from Michael Grant on it.

The gist of it was this: the author had some sort of mental breakdown, possibly schizophrenia, and murdered his wife. Afterwards, he received enough treatment that he was able to write a book about the experience and his guilt. I want to say it was written in the 60s but that is a rough estimate. Also, I feel like his last name was Ball or Balt, but not sure.

In either 7th (2013-2014 academic year) or 8th grade (2014-2015), a book on the Smarter Balanced ELA (English/Language Arts) test caught my eye. (For information on SBAC and other standardized testing in WA, look [here](http://www.k12.wa.us/smarter/default.aspx) and [here](http://www.k12.wa.us/assessment/StateTesting/).) Now, I may have some of these details wrong, as it was four or more years ago, and I have ADHD and all the memory problems that come with it. Bearing that in mind, these are all the things I think I remember about this book. * The author was female (I'm only ~60% sure about this one) * The main character was a young boy named Ry. (I am 100% certain of this; the reason the passage first caught my interest was because I have a character of my own who is also named Ry.) * The book had won some kind of prize or medal (either Nobel or Pulitzer, I think). * The title included something like ""The Edge of the World"" or ""The End of the World."" * The passage that was used in the test described Ry climbing a slope(?) of some kind near a train station in the middle of an enormous empty field. He was alone, and he might have had some kind of amnesia. He wanted to catch a train to try and get home, but none had come, so he'd decided to try and find water (I think). A train approached and he tried to run back to catch it, but his foot got caught on a root and he tripped (I believe he hurt his ankle doing this). * He might have been thinking about a parent throughout the scene, I'm not 100% certain That's about all I can remember. Thanks a bunch in advance; the book seemed really good just from reading that passage, and I've wanted to read the whole thing all these years.

I remember it starting out in Europe describing this couple and how absolutely miserable each member in their family is. The couple gets separated and the guy ends up traveling to South America and acquires a ship full of gold from El Dorado. He ends up being betrayed and left with nothing. He also meets a young noble in his castle who is the only happy person in the book by simply not caring about anything. ""Carpe Diem"" I believe was a mentioned theme. The couple eventually reunite and live their lives in Turkey.

My most favourite (I know it said top ten) I don’t remember the title or author I had read this in late primary school,(in late high school) and it was my first ever novel, it was about a young greyhound that lived and loved a young boy, but was kidnaped while in a park to be used to race, leading to eventually someone from the military to adopt or buy the dog which then went to war, (forgot most details, sorry) and the climax of the book is that the greyhound comes back to his original hometown to the boys house or park to find him older and with a new dog and the boy remarking how he had a greyhound just like him once before. If it helps I am in year 11 in Australia so you have a time frame I guess, and I read the book around year 4-6. Thanks to anyone that can find this.

8s25ba	book	extra	reddit	[TOMT] Pre-teen/tween book about a girl that talks to animals published around 2013-15. So i read this book from my library a few years ago. I'm 15 so a few years ago i was still trolling around in the kids section of the library. It was a fantasy book about a red haired green eyed girl of about 12 who could speak to animals. I think she runs away with her best friend pet donkey, who decided he wants to stay, i think? She ends up in the desert searching for an oasis and finds a caravan led by a woman who gives her peppermint tea. She goes to a big kingdom and is told that the king will take her as one of his many wives as soon as she gets her period. She befriends a servant. She wakes up with stomach pains one morning and thinks she might have been poisoned so she calls in the servant and it turns out she got her period so she needs to hide it. She goes and talks to the moon goddess at a lake in a cave. The goddess tells her she has great power within her and to be her true self. At the end i remember people were coming after her (her dad? The king?) and she dug deep within herself to channel the earth and attacked them with vines. Its the first one of a trilogy but the second and third books hadn't come out when i first read it. I found the name a year or two ago and promptly forgot it. I've tried googling it but it's not coming up. You can surely understand how being able to remember so much about a book/series but not its title or author. Help would be much appreciated

8s7n7p	book	extra	reddit	[TOMT] [Book] Thriller/suspense, takes place at a (boarding?) school, character called Hawthorne, man with red hair, snow, female main character.. I read this book during my teens, and though I don't even remember whether it was any good, it bothers me that I can't remember the title. Figured I'd give this a shot. Google searches have yielded no results so far. Here's what I remember: * The story takes place at what might have been a boarding school, or just a regular high school. * There's a character named Hawthorn(e), who might be either a teacher or the headmaster. * The book starts out with a prologue in which a man with red hair attacks (murders maybe?) someone at the pool. It's a fragment from the end of the book and only makes sense later. * Pretty sure it had a female main character, or at least a prominent one. * It also tells a side story about one of the female students who does some shady stuff to get money. * It's winter near the end of the book, and there's a heavy snowstorm. The female main has to tread through it on foot to get somewhere, possibly stop the attack.
8sav2b	book	extra	reddit	[TOMT][book] Post-apocalyptic novel where all men have turned into monsters. Literally. It was told from the viewpoint of a highschool girl watching the outbreak of a disease that only affects men and boys for some reason. All these boys at her school (including her boyfriend) started running insanely-high temperatures, having leaking, bloody eyes and becoming aggressive and violent---or else just collapsing, seizing and dying. She went home to find that her father has beaten her mother to death so she takes her younger sister and runs. Then it cuts to three years later. She's a scout for the all-female outpost she lives at. They have rings of defenses; the surviving males behave more like pack animals than human beings, and have also evolved to become huge, hulking behemoths of muscle and seemingly only-barely sentient. Any female they happen upon will be brutally torn apart. Their doctor/researcher takes specimins the girl has captured and cages and injects them with substances she hopes will provide a cure (but actually just kill them, thus far) but not before giving each one a name, a backstory, and one particular thing that makes him special---'he was teaching himself to play the guitar' 'he loves dogs' 'his kids were his whole world' etc. There's also glimpses at life in the outpost, straight women adjusting to life with no men, little girls growing up in disbelief that kissing/marrying boys was a thing that ever happened, gay women just fine with the new normal, etc. Oh, and of course at one point the protagonist encounters the only immune male that may actually exist, and tries to keep him secret from the others who want to experiment on/kill him. I seem to recall the book being called 'Ferals' or something to that effect; it was a very good book and I should have bought it when I had the chance.

Then on the last page the solution could be found. Would be incredibly grateful if someone had any idea what this was.

I think it described how people lived back then but I only looked at the pictures. I specifically remember one guy pooping in a bathroom to show the septic system in those times. Some pages would be dense with dialogue describing what you'd see in the following image. The book had a white hardcover, and bigger than an I Spy book and thick with pages.

He meets a Vietnamese girl living there who starts out acting like a jerk to him but warms up a bit later, and it's revealed near the end that she's his half sister- it's mentioned a few times throughout the book that the boy's father died in Vietnam. This is literally all I can remember (it's been nearly 20 years, cut me some slack) but I randomly remembered this book existed earlier and now I'm driving myself nuts trying to remember anything else about it.
