127931	book	jdoc-annotated	librarything	Young girl living in city writes poetry. This is a book I read about 40 years ago. The girl lives in NYC or some other metropolis. They live near the ""El"", so they can't hear each other when the trains go by. Her father is a taxi driver, and has a bad heart. The girl likes to write, and enters a contest to win money to help her father have a vacation. The subject of the contest is a muffin mix. She writes a limerick about having baked muffins even though it was in the heat of summer. Any ideas?
57827	book	jdoc-annotated	librarything	Illustrated children's fiction book. There was a series of books I read when I was in elementary school, around 13 years ago. Aimed towards 2nd or 3rd grade reading level? It was, in general, one page of text, and one page of colored pictures. The pictures were quite vivid and brightly colored, and had a realistic style. The first page of each book would be all descriptions, I think. Talking about how beautiful the glade or whatever was. Setting the scene. I don't remember most of the plots. There was one about... horses, I believe. Maybe a horse that had no friends? I remember another one was about this cat that was very fat, and could not catch mice. One day a mouse comes along and helps the cat exercise, and the cat loses weight. It was a series, but the books did not share characters or anything. Like most children's books, they all had some sort of message. They were not that short. I don't think they had chapters, but they were not like those children books that only have one line of text per page. They were taller than a trade-paperback, and maybe around a centimeter thick. Thank you so much!
20772	book	jdoc-annotated	librarything	Name this short story about the Big Bang. I've been trying to track down this short story for a while, but can't remember/google either the author or title. It's about a person who suddenly wakes up and is trapped in his head, realizes he has no access to any of his outside senses, and in an attempt to stave off gradual insanity, he invents an elaborate world in his head, creating forces of 'good' and 'evil', constantly dueling it out, to ensure the story never ends. The last words of the story are 'Let there be light'. It's extremely short, probably only a few pages long. Sound familiar to anyone?
41717	book	jdoc-annotated	librarything	Lost literary fiction, recent. I can't remember the name of a book I read very recently, probably published in the last few years. The protagonist was a girl who moves from Tasmania to New York, where she gets a job at a huge used books store called, I think, The Arcade. The rest of the book is a mystery concerning a lost work by a famous 19th century author, which one specifically I've forgotten. Please help?
113809	book	jdoc-annotated	librarything	Multiracial adoption story, large family. I know it's a novel, and I think I read it about ten to twelve years ago. It was a book about a white couple who decided to adopt a child, then ended up adopting a double-digit number of them over the course of the book with no thought to nationality or special needs. I remember some specific scenes. One had the couple so poor that they were forced to eat a five-to-ten year-old decorative can of rattlesnake meat, opening it from the bottom so that they could wash it out and continue to display it. Also, there was a scene later in the book in which one of the couple's black daughters begged her parents to wash her skin until it was white like theirs. My mother or grandmother gave this to me, so I'm pretty sure it was intended for young adult or adult audiences. It had chapters, so I'm pretty sure it wasn't a children's book or teen fiction. The edition I read was paperback, with a tan cover. On the cover was artwork depicting several people from the shoulders up- can't remember how many. It was a standard-sized paperback, maybe the width of an adult's index or middle finger.

68922	book	jdoc-annotated	librarything	YA Fantasy about a young boy and a maze, in a cave and possible war between clans?. Some time in the early 80's I read a book that I cannot remember the name of. Since it was so long ago, I can only remember bits and pieces of it. This is what I remember: It was about a young boy who was sent to his room (on his birthday, I think) and looked out his window and saw a huge maze that started at his window. He walked the maze to mountains and the next thing I remember was that he found himself in a cave for a long time. They (the clan) used animal hides to cover the entrance of the cave and I remember the character talking about coming out of the cave at some point and the light being extremely bright. I vaguely remember the clan he was with was going to war and it was up to him to save the world or something like that. Unfortunately that's all I remember! If any of this rings a bell to anyone, I would appreciate your response!
129136	book	jdoc-annotated	librarything	Kids' activity book about a little boy and sister in search for the legend of the giant turtle. Hi, I used to have this book when I was much younger (~1997) about a boy and his sister (I think Aztecan) who set off in search of a legendary giant turtle. It is more or less an activity book which had a tablet-like-bookmark (made of card, of course, with dimensions roughly ~10x10 cm). The corners of this tablet-like-bookmark had bees on them, and about 5 holes to see through. Throughout the book there were hidden things we had to find by placing the tablet on each page, aligning the bees on the tablet to various coloured bees on the pages. The correct orientation of the tablet would reveal these hidden objects. Usually each double page had 3 things we had to find: 1) Our next destination. 2) How to get there (either by road, river, bridge, etc.). 3) A small activity regarding that particular page. The book was not very long, about 30 pages or so but, it was very coulourfull. Enough to hide all the objects and markings. A few pages I can remember are: The Ravine, where a monster is in the ravine which you need to cross by walking on one of the two wooden bridges. One of the bridges has maggots in them and will break. So this is where you use the tablet, with the help of the bees, to know which bridge is safe to cross. Other pages include The Observatory, The Waterfall. Unfortunately I really can not remember the rest. This book was targeted at ages 5~9 (I guess). I would really appreciate it if anyone knew it. It was so much fun at the time, just wish to get my hands on it again and preserve it! The title sounds something like: Legend of the Giant Turtle or Search for the Giant Turtle or The Giant Turtle of ...
21768	book	jdoc-annotated	librarything	help finding a book. Perhaps 5 years ago I read a book (I think the book was newly out then) about this woman who finds a time travel portal on her grandparents (I think it was) farm in the mountains somewhere in the eastern U.S. She goes through and finds herself in old England. It seems as if she has to disguise herself as a boy. The portal on that side is in a church I believe. She finds the love of her life in old England. Travels back and forth . Discovers that one of her relatives had also done the time travel. If anyone has any suggestions for me I would certainly appreciate them.
3861	book	jdoc-annotated	librarything	Trying to identify a short story...would appreciate help. - Short story written in the mid to late 1980s IIRC - Focus is two high school boys who are friends. - immediate setting is a cafeteria/fast-food joint - wider setting are the high school kids living in an economically depressed US that is fighting an interminable war in Central America. Students wrestling with the pros and cons of joining up. - background themes of govt propaganda to sustain recruiting and morale when things are dismal. The war is televised/fictionalised. Certain GIs get their 15 minutes of fame as 'Johnny America' IIRC. I think the enemy is 'Pedro'. light infantry are equipped with missiles as section/platoon weapons. - story ends with some sort of fight in the cafeteria. one of the boys, and one of the girls decide to join up for their own reasons. - Not being able to remember anything else is making me a bit nutty. Hope I can track this down before the men in white jackets have to take me away.
114836	book	jdoc-annotated	librarything	SF short story(?), empire loses a war waiting for best technology. Very little info - this is something my dad read 'many' years ago (70s-80s? Possibly 50s-60s, probably not 90s or later). He remembers it as a short story, possibly in a magazine (he was reading Analog, Asimov, F&SF, etc at the time). A galactic empire is fighting a war. They have much better technology than their opponents. However, their opponents keep fighting while the empire keeps waiting for the next upgrade, not maintaining the (practically obsolete!) equipment they already have, pulling their ships back to update them...and they lose the war. No idea of title or author. Does this ring bells for anyone?
42904	book	jdoc-annotated	librarything	YA?, about a girl who was almost invisible. I read this book about 5 years ago (maybe. I'm really bad with estimating time). I'm pretty sure it is young adult, but it may have been for kids in middle school. The book was about this girl that was (i guess) so tiny or washed out that nobody saw her unless they knew exactly where she was. She ends up just living inside the walls of her house, and her family kind of forgets about her. She creates all sorts of hidden passageways to get from one place to another. Eventually she grows to be a teenager and meets people on the ouside for the first time....and I think she then goes to a halloween party? she definetly meets a boy. I think it was after she overheard her mother talking to a man about the house getting destroyed and her mom didn't want that to happen even though she wasn't quite sure why. I remember this one scene where the girl's mom arranged for a woman to come and meet her. Her mom put the girl on a chair next to a doll and the woman thought they were concerned about the doll or something....like she didn't even see the girl or realize that was who they were talking about. And then somehow the girl got stuck into the woman's purse and taken outside...and her mom was really upset. I think the girl had a sister, too. This might be way too much information or not enough. Let me know if you can think of the title or need more info!
111795	book	jdoc-annotated	librarything	YA fantasy: boy meets shadow people. It may be upper level children's instead. It's pre-1980s and is about a boy who goes to a house with a garden. When there he discovers and befriends shadow people. Anything that casts its shadow in the garden is then around for the shadow people's use. There are statues in the garden and a dolphin statue is important. I seem to think it's how he was able to see the shadow people but I'm not certain. There's a portion where he takes his birthday cake outside so the shadow people can have some too.

The narrator (a young girl) has a younger sister who is killed when she's thrown from a horse. There's a scene where the girl is shaken up to see her father crying after the accident. It may take place around the turn of the 20th century. I read it in the late '70s.
93190	book	jdoc-annotated	librarything	Poetry Anthology Book--Need Title, please. I donated a poetry anthology several years ago. It is one of the few items I have regretted donating. Can anyone help with a title, given these clues? Published prior to 2000, most likely published before 1995. I did not have a jacket, but hardcover was a shade of red. Had a thinner red ribbon marker attached. Pages were white, of closer to tissue-paper thinness. All poems were in English, as I recall. Spanned ancient times to the present (at time of publication). Had several ""shape"" poems toward end, including one shaped like the helix. Was about novel size and thickness. Possibly has a book publisher or book company name in the title. Many thanks. (Have done several online searches with ""shape poem"" and ""helix"" and have started looking through Amazon, using keyword--poetry anthologies, but no luck as of yet).
50119	book	jdoc-annotated	librarything	Girl in the Windmill?. Hey everyone! I have an extremely vague memory of a paperback book I read growing up in the '80s that featured a girl who would spend time in a windmill (or perhaps a boat or some other structure?) that was abandoned on her family's property (perhaps her grandmother's?). I seem to remember small details, like her hiking out to the windmill, bringing a picnic and sort of camping out there and reading books, which sounded like so much fun. This is extremely vague, I apologize, but if this rings a bell to anyone...

73205	book	jdoc-annotated	librarything	children's ghost story - going to a party in a big house. Short story I read as a kid. Possibly I'm mixing it in my memory with other stories. In my memory, a big house shows up in the neighborhood, and holds a great party. It's everything a kid could want. Protagonist(s) want to go to the party, and do; they leave early, somehow, then discover the house was haunted or would have taken them away, or all the kids were ghost-kids, or something like that. I read this story in a collection, but can't place it. I had thought perhaps in ""Alfred Hitchcock's Ghostly Gallery"" or ""Alfred Hitchcock's Haunted Houseful"" but can't verify. I semi-recall another story that I think was in this collection (how many more vagaries can I include?) -- it somehow reminded me of the characters from The Wind in the Willows but involved, again, something spooky and out-of-character. -- lquilter
100990	book	jdoc-annotated	librarything	Childrens book from the late 70s called ""Things""???. Hi everyone I have a wonderful memory of my father reading me a book as a small child that I believe was called ""Things"" (not to be confused with ""Where the Wild Things Are""). I have been searching on the internet for ages but can't seem to find it. I was born in 1978 so I assume the book was either published in the 70s or the early 80s. It was mainly a picture book or weird imaginary pictures of weird hairy circular creatures called ""things"" .... each page had these fantastic pictures with wording like ""Big things and little things, Things in the moon, Shy Things and Loud Things"" etc.... Does this ring a bell for anyone? I would be so grateful if someone could point me to author & correct title. Thanks :) Nikki

72921	book	jdoc-annotated	librarything	YA Novel, read in 1995, Post-Apocalyptic Reversion to Medieval Times. Premise is that everyone on earth suddenly becomes afraid of technology, and walks away from their cars, radios, etc. and forgets how they work. Protagonist is a girl, and I wanted to say it was called something like ""The Changes"", but I can't find anything like that online. Although searching for phrases like ""changes"" and ""afraid of technology"" are bound to produce every result but the one you had in mind! Does anyone else remember this one? The date might not be exact, but that's when I think I read it, give or take a few years.
63477	book	jdoc-annotated	librarything	novel, monk gathering St. Catherine's relics. Fiction I read this around 2000, it was absolutely not written after fall of 2001 since I read it before I went to Europe and I was looking for Catherine's Wheels in all the art while I was there thanks to this book. It was a novel, about a monk in the medieval period (I think, I'm suddenly unclear about this) who was seeking to gather together the relics of St. Catherine. Possibly ended in a hermitage in Alexandria. The monk could hear her scattered body parts talking to him, but his order did not feel that he should be doing this, so some other group is maybe trying to stop him or collect her before he does? I'm fuzzy on this. I don't think it was marketed as a supernatural book, or a religious book, or a crime thriller, but more just a story/novel. It may have had the word Translation/Translated in the title (not referring to translation of the book, but the religious term of translation in terms of the removal of relics). Arrgh, this is driving me nuts. Thanks to anyone who can help!

53741	book	jdoc-annotated	librarything	Need help with name and author. I read a book many (10-15 or more?) years ago and I would like to read it again. I know that there was a woman spending time alone sorting through her life. She was in the northeast (Cape Cod? Nantucket?) - I think in a house on a beach. One distinguishing feature that I do remember is that she either had been to or was planning to attend the annual meeting of the Modern Language Association (MLA), I believe in New York City. So I think she was some variety of an academic. If you don't know that one, but know of others with similar characteristics (especially woman taking time by herself in a house on the beach to figure out who she is and where she is going), I would be interested in those too.

22268	book	jdoc-annotated	librarything	Children abducted for social experiment - kid's book 60s-70s. I'm looking for a book told from a perspective of a girl age ~12 who mysteriously (I can't remember the details) awakes in a weird school-type environment with other kids. They learn, eat, sleep, and do homework on a set schedule, but never have any contact with adults. Everything is automated and they just follow the schedule. It's not a bad life and our hero's academic performance improves, but she's understandably confused and wonders who is behind their situation. At one point, the kids rebel - why are we here, anyway? - and they are punished with some sort of nerve gas that paralyzes them causes them to hear loud sounds and smell a horrible smell. They all behave, but the main character and one other child escape at the end of the novel and on their way out of the building read files that reveal details of the experiment. I read this around 1988, but I don't remember it being particularly ""new."" I think it had to be published in the 60s or 70s, no later than 1985. After a few years of thinking about it, I remembered the title - ""The Hawthorne Experiment."" That makes sense, because the Hawthone experiments dealt with the way the subjects of an experiement change their behavior when they know they've being observed. The only problem is that my memory must be wrong, unless it's not in the Library of Congress catalog. I have been going crazy trying to figure this out for at least seven years. It's pretty obscure and this is a long shot, but if anyone can help, I will die of joy. Thanks for reading!

94761	book	jdoc-annotated	librarything	Book about a ""silly / stupid family"" for older children -- this is a tough one!. My sister and I have been puzzling over this one for years. It's a book that dates to the 1960s or before, about a ""silly"" family (with the word silly or stupid in the title). The wife makes the husband do rather silly things to stave off danger, like during a rainstorm, standing in a tub of water, or standing on a chair in the closet in the dark while holding a wire hanger. She has a reason why he should do this, and he goes along. The book consists of separate chapters, each with a different such incident. It is illustrated with line drawings. It was really funny to us when We read it as kids, and my sister read it to her kids in the 1980s as well. I have a sense that it could have been written before the 1960s, since ours was an older library copy. We think the words ""silly"" or ""stupid"" and ""family"" possibly were in the title, but aren't certain. I've done a number of google and LT searches to no avail. Help!

115019	book	jdoc-annotated	librarything	Historical YA time travel. I read a book in 2001 or 2002 about a young (high school age) couple who travel back in time to the medieval period. They're assumed to be married and have to share a bed and things get awwwwkward. The girl is captured by an evil villain who possibly wants to marry her and trap her in the medieval period forever. Oh, and she does magic! She might live in a shop with her grandmother in a 'she taught her everything she knows' way. The boy might be called Jared or something like that? Towards the end he fights the villain who captured the girl. If I remember correctly, his parents died, possibly in a car crash. I think they meet in science class, possibly when the boy gets so angry that something blows up, and she heals him. And at one point they're in a cafe with classmates and he ignores her and she gets annoyed. Does that sound familiar to anyone? The book was quite big and my paperback copy was greeny-gray coloured, I think the picture was of clouds or a storm, possibly with a castle on the front. I remember being absolutely in love with the book and would like to reread it to see if it's as good as I remember = Thanks for your help!

It may sound childish, but I strongly remember it. Any help would be greatly appreciated.

27625	book	jdoc-annotated	librarything	Teen book girl being brainwashed by aunt and uncle. I read this book probably about twenty years ago and can't remember the name of the book or the author. An orphaned girl lives happily with her Aunt until one day the Aunt marries some really creepy man. They go to live in his house where he has three daughters from his first marriage. These daughters never leave the house or go to school and the man has brainwashed the Aunt into his way of thinking, which I think is some weird cross between an extreem religion and a desire to protect and control his children. The girl wants a normal life and tries to escape, even to the point of getting out and begging the neighbours to help her but the Aunt and Uncle catch her and tell the neighbours she is mentally disabled and not to pay her any attention. Eventually the middle daughter (who I think is called Helen) becomes caught up in the girl's description of real life, friends, school etc and agrees to help her. The girl pretends to be coming around to the Uncle's way of thinking and is eventually allowed to leave the house in the company of his daughters. They go jogging late at night for exercise with a cover story of looking for a lost puppy. This is how the girl and Helen escape. I'm not sure if that's how it ends or just all I can remember but I'm trying to replace my old books and this was one that got away somehow but that I would like to track down.

Hi, I'm looking for this book about a girl and her mum who own an antique shop, and a strange boy comes to work for them, telling the loveliest yarns about their antiques to customers. First (I think), a grandfather clock that was owned by a fatalistic irishman, whose belief in his fated death led to it; and then something about a jewellery box (?) in India... Basically, he managed to come up with colourful stories that made their antiques sell well, but this didn't go down well with the girl/her mum who had a policy of not lying.. and then it started turning out each of the stories was true.. And in the end, the boy turned out to be a lonely author getting lost in his book and the girl and her mum were characters therein... I've been racking my mind for a while but can't come up with anything... other than *I think* it was a female author..
92996	book	jdoc-annotated	librarything	YA SciFi. Teen genious with military moves.. I read this novel about 8 to 10 years ago. It may have been a novella. Not sure. Anyway, it takes place somewhere in space and in the somewhat far future. Teenage boy works for government doing stuff on a computer creating virtual moves so the army can move ahead and accomplish those moves. The teenager has a relationship with some teen female, they have some love story. This is a guess, but I can't remember too well, I think they try to run away at some point with some friends of theirs. Also, the novel is first person perspective, in the boy's view. No idea what any of the names for the characters were. At some points, the words were italicized, and the boy would narrate the time. That's all I can think of right now, also, the cover, I remember was either orange or red with a grid looking thing on it. Maybe even yellow. Please help if you can. Thanks.!
74255	book	jdoc-annotated	librarything	YA Fiction, 7-9 years ago, Boy is bored & taken away to a magical house, four seasons in a day, can'. I really can't remember much about this Book, it just popped into my head and I really want to find it now. I'm not even sure whether I actually read it or dreamt it haha. anyway... How I remember it: A Young boy either a) fights with his mother and is in his room angry at her b) Is just bored on school holidays in his room (I get the feeling this is set in England) A crazy man comes in either: a) by flying through the window b) or appearing with a ""pop"" The man offers the boy a life of fun and freedom the boy accepts. They then travel to a house of some sort where there are all four seasons in a day. As I remember it he loves it there then sinister undertones are revealed and the boy begins to miss his family. He tries to escape but everytime he goes through the gate it simply leads him back to the house through some sort of magic. In the end he escapes using some sort of rope or sling shot contraption. It's really sad in the end because he only stays there for about 10 days but on the outside world that is equivalent to 10 years and his parents have put out missing persons posters and stuff and he has been missing for the whole time. Ring a bell anyone?? Like I said I probably made a lot of these details up. Thanks heaps Aleesha

116403	book	jdoc-annotated	librarything	Young boy dies and enters new world. Hello! I've been looking for this book for a while and can't remember an awful lot except the beginning. The young boy's brother dies and someone says what a pity it is that he didn't die instead as the older brother was handsome and clever etc etc. Somehow this boy ends up dying to try and be with his brother and ends up in a fantasy world where he is someone special too (or all people are special?) and there's a horse (perhaps on the cover?). Urgh, none of that is particularly helpful, but it's been really bugging me and thought someone here might know!
116997	book	jdoc-annotated	librarything	children's book about a girl and a welsh dragon with no name. Hi All, I'm looking for the title of a book, or maybe a series of books, that I read as a child - would probably have been late 70s, maybe early 80s at a push. It was about a girl who went on holiday to Wales (UK) and found a friendly dragon living in a cave on the beach. She brought him food (he was always hungry, usually a bun or something) and he told her his name so she could call him whenever she was in trouble. The best thing was though his name was never mentioned in the story, so it was a secret. Lots of adventures followed, although I can't remember any of them. I also recall something about not running around a rock three times anticlockwise because that would summon up a witch - which of course the little girl did and then had to be rescued. I have very fond memories of the story and would love to find it again - although maybe that's a bad idea as it will never be as i remember it from childhood. All suggestions gratefully received.
129317	book	jdoc-annotated	librarything	Science Fiction, probably 1970s. It would be great if someone could ID this book that keeps niggling at me. (Don't you hate when that happens?) There were two alien species. One was very aggressive and drafted skilled workers from a more peaceful species onto large spaceships. The ships also had a population of the peaceful species that called themselves ship bred or ship born. The POV is mostly a ship born female. They used implants for inter-species communications. The very aggressive species set aside sections of the ship for raising their own young and were even unpredictable and explosively violent near that area. The female overlord-type running one ship drafted a technician, implanted him, paired him with the POV female of his species. Then she bought a human spacer out of lot of wild humans and added him to the group and ordered the other two to see if they could come to understand him. Along the way, there was a planetary invasion/destruction, because the humans had on it didn't immediately comply the demands of the overlord-types. The POV female discovered she was unable to function under an open sky. The implanted human insisted on rescuing a human child, much to the bafflement of the other two species. There was a rival ship, run by a male overlord-type, that also picked up some humans and wound up putting a mother and her child in the nesting area because they didn't have any children of their own species. The two ships came together and established some sort of alliance/relationship. The book had a Cherryh feel in that it threw you into alien cultures without much explanation, but it isn't one of hers. Any suggestions would be appreciated.

104756	book	jdoc-annotated	librarything	fiction set during Jesus' time. I read this book in 1999 in 8th grade for a middle school academic decathlon. I can't remember title or author. All I know is that it was set around the time Jesus lived and was about to be crucified. The main character lived alone with his sister. I think both of their parents died already. If I remember correctly, his sister was disabled in some way... not sure. He was really protective of her. A roman soldier or something came by to see his sister a lot, which really pissed him off. I think later he joined some kind of cult or rebellion. I remember Jesus being a minor character in the book (not sure if he had lines), but still significant in some way to the group that the main character joined. I can't remember if the book was religious or not. I do remember the main character being really cynical about everythign but eventually loosening up with regard to his sister and the roman soldier. Does this sound familiar to anyone? if it helps, this book was required for the jr high school academic decathlon for anyone who did the literature section in 1999. I greatly enjoyed the book and would appreciate any help towards finding it. Thanks.

They meet an old man who gives them a magical bowl that's can produce food on demand.
36108	book	jdoc-annotated	librarything	looking for a book I read as a kid. I'm in search of a book I read as a kid.... It is a childrens picture book, I'm guessing it was probably published in the late 1960's, its about two sisters that share a bedroom. The younger sister puts a jump rope in the middle of the room to divide it only to realize she has given her sister the door to get out on her side of the room. The girl imagines having all these children and a horse in the room and visitors arriving in a basket through the window...at the end I think they wind up making up and going to play ""jump rope"" together. The pictures in the book were sort of sketched and they were mostly black and white, the girl had braids and freckles. If anyone remembers this book, I would be so happy I have been looking for years and I know my copy is long gone after all its use. Thanks
126740	book	jdoc-annotated	librarything	autobiographical-travels of two young french men. hello. i'm trying to remember the name of a book i began reading a year or two ago. it is an account of the travels of two young french men. did they travel by motorcycle? car? was this perhaps pre cars? it might have been pre world world war II, although i think after world war I. one of the men was an artist and i think this was the genesis for the travels which took them to macedonia, maybe? perhaps near northern africa? greece? poland? the one recounting the travels became a journalist i think (or maybe was just a writer). i think the gist of the book was the two men had just finished or were finishing their studies and this was a time before they had any real responsibilities and the freedom they felt exploring the edges of europe. i think the artist had an offer to show his work somewhere random (yugoslavia/macedonia) and that is where the journey began. it might have been post world war II and pre vietnam but i am not thinking that is correct.
109493	book	jdoc-annotated	librarything	YA SciFi with ""energy particle"" alien who visits boy. I read this YA SciFi book in sometime around the late 80s or early 90s. The protagonist boy gets visited by an alien who takes the form of energy particles that are like static and the boy can feel them as tingles. The first time they ""meet"" is in the boy's bedroom at night. There is a scene early on where the boy is walking down his driveway in the winter and realizes he has been floating because he has not left any footprints in the snow (the alien made him float somehow). Eventually, the alien takes the boy on the spaceship (which I believe has a transparent floor or wall so he can see space) and they go to a planet (might be the moon, not sure about that). Unfortunately, I don't remember much else about it. Thanks for any help!

I thought I had read Ozma of Oz but the plot I remember seems different from what I can see in the book description here. I remember it being about a boy who was enslaved to a witch but he ran away and eventually it turns out that he was a missing princess who had been disguised as a baby. I also remember something about escaping from a tower on a flying, sentient, bed who I think was called Gump, or the Gump, but that might have been a different Oz book. Can you help me with what book or books this was?
55722	book	jdoc-annotated	librarything	Science fiction, man trapped in a ""time box"" (?), lots of push-ups and sit-ups. I've been trying to figure this out for years. I recall reading a science fiction novel (or possibly short story) where a main plot element was a man (boy?) trapped in some type of box/container/cell where the flow of time was altered. From his perspective time moved normally, but the outside world was standing still. I feel like he was trapped for at least a year, during which time he had nothing to do but eat some kind of protein bars and do lots of exercises like push-ups and sit-ups. I think he was plotting to get even with someone upon his release. The book was almost certainly published in the 70s or 80s. I appreciate any clues you might have. Thanks!

100477	book	jdoc-annotated	librarything	Book of horror stories. About ten years ago I checked out a book from the library that was authored by two guys with the same last name. The book had been published in the UK and the cover was white with a silhouette of a cemetery on the bottom. While the writing was good I can only fully remember one story, a tale about a reporter who learns of a mountain where, years before, an experimental atomic plane had crashed. Upon visiting the area he runs into a number of residents with severe mutations. Does this ring any bells?
117068	book	jdoc-annotated	librarything	1990s Children's/YA Book boy left in France - cave. I read a book at some point in the 1990s and would love to read it again, but can't seem to find it on google. It's a young adult book about a boy who goes on holiday to France with his parents, but they're arguing a lot and his mum is really stressed because she has to drive around the Peripherique. His parents are in two cars as they have lots of luggage and a few children (I think), and the boy accidentally gets left behind (like in Home Alone), but no-one notices as they leave in separate cars. He has to fend for himself and shelters in a cave. I remember that at one point he has some wet matches, and he gets food by building a dam to catch fish and stealing eggs from a farm. I think it was by a British author but it may not have been - any ideas would be most appreciated (maybe my googling skills aren't good enough!)
81224	book	jdoc-annotated	librarything	YA Horse story (mystery?) set in Sweden. I read this in the 1970's. A young lady belongs to a riding club in Sweden. There was a mystery going on, but I can't remember what all it involved. One of the activities of the club was to do a torchlight horseback ride. The cover I remember (this was a paperback) was in tones of blue, a girl and a guy riding side by side holding torches. I hope this rings a bell with someone--I'd like to read it again for old times' sake.
87239	book	jdoc-annotated	librarything	Mid-70s horror anthology, possibly through the Scholastic Book Club. There were 2 stories in this collection that I remember well, though both titles and authors are forgotten. The first involved a man thrown into a prison that was a giant underground device that rotated. The prisoners had to pull ropes for a set amount of time every day to make the prison turn. Eventually, their cell would rotate around to the outside world and they would be released. There were gaps or irregularities in the walls that would appear every so often, allowing some movement between cells. Actually, I'd be happy if anyone could just identify this story. The second story involved a guy who had some sort of strange parasite like a slug (described as seal brown?) and he could only get rid of it by convincing some other person that his story was true and the parasite would then move to the new host. What else I remember: I am reasonably sure I got this through the Scholastic Book Club, but it does not appear to have been published by Scholastic themselves. The cover may have been either a dark teal/petrol or a rusty brown. The first story may, but only may, have been The Willows by Algernon Blackwood. I could have sworn I remembered reading the second story above while sitting in the car and hearing Bob Seger's Night Moves. The only problem is that I was a freshman in high school by the time that was released and I think the SBC stopped in middle school at that time. I also thought that ""The Man Who Sold Rope to the Gnoles"" by Margaret St. Clair was in there, but I was able to track down a publishing history for that and there were no matches with what I remember.
44036	book	jdoc-annotated	librarything	Another YA book--red canaries. You guys were so good at figuring out my other books so have a go at this one. It was about someone trying to breed red canaries and involved a teenage girl and a relative who had an aviary in their barn. Sound familiar? Searching the red canary tag didn't come up with anything. I read it in the late 60's probably?
34112	book	jdoc-annotated	librarything	Help, can't remember - Regency, hero named Devlin, bluestocking. I think this one must be pretty old. It seems like it was a skinny little thing (possibly a Signet or Harlequin Historical). Plot-wise The hero is a nobleman named Devlin and a confirmed bachelor. The heroine is (I think) the sister of one of his good friends, and I believe she was something of a bluestocking. One of the scenes I remember best is when he was napping on the couch in the library, and she was looking for a big book and accidentally drops Shakespeare on him - and then falls on him herself. I also seem to remember something about crab cakes. There was a young inventor who was also in love with her and made a point to come to her salons. This one was really funny, and I loved it when I was younger, but I can't seem to find it at home anymore. Anybody have any ideas? crossposted to Name that Book group
72482	book	jdoc-annotated	librarything	YA/Chapter Book, involves limb-stealing society of mole rat-like creatures. Fiction. A couple kids and their mother spend a summer at a cabin in the woods. The forest is being cut down, the foresters are being taken away in the night and returned sans a body part or two, surgically removed. The kids stumble upon a society of intelligent subterranean creatures with a similar social structure to mole rats (i.e. one large, reproducing queen ruling over a colony of workers and warriors) who are stealing limbs and such from people to replace their own malfunctioning ones. I can't recall if the mole rat similarity is actually mentioned in the book. I read it at least 10 years ago, not exactly sure, and I'm pretty sure it was for teens, possibly a bit younger. Can't remember anything about the author or title, and while I can't quite remember I'm pretty sure it was a chapter book, softcover, with a kind of creepy cover illustration. This story has been bugging me for awhile because it was just so weird, and I'd like to read it again, so if anyone has heard of this before that would be amazing.

Any clues?
35257	book	jdoc-annotated	librarything	The Prince & his Fate. I don't know if I've posted re this one already but I thought it was worth another try even if I have - it's been driving me crazy for years. This story was part of a collection I read when I was young (?70's prob). It's one of the usual fairy stories except I haven't been able to find it in any collections since. This is the only story I remember so if anyone can remember ANY collections with it in I'd be very grateful. Usual thing, young prince is born, fairies come around & prophecy that he will meet his death. It will be either at the hands of a dog, an alligator/crocodile or a snake. Parents put him in a tower to keep him safe, he see's a dog & they let him have it has a pet (fools!!), I think time then passes, he goes on a trip to meet his bride - who manages to save him from at least 2 of his 'fates' - puts out a dish of milk with sleeping potion & kills the snake & drags him out of the river when the dog knocks him in - can't remember what she did with the crocodile. The last line was something along the lines of 'My wife is stronger than my fate'. I can picture the illustrations in it & everything. Hopefully someone remembers this, if not I'll have to start believing I made it up.

72294	book	jdoc-annotated	librarything	Children's book - Birds paint rocks to look like eggs to fool snake. I'm trying to track this down for a patron. She can't narrow the publication date any more than 1930-1970. I think I got most of the plot in the title. The snake is eating the birds' eggs, so the birds paint rocks to look like eggs. I'm assuming it's a picture book.
8868	book	jdoc-annotated	librarything	I need help finding a children's mystery book. I don't remember too much about the book anymore. I read it in the mid 90's. It was a hardcover. I used to think the title was ""The Midnight Hour"" but I've searched everywhere for it and have had no luck (it is not by Karen Robards). The characters were animals (definately had a lion and a pig in it). The only thing I remember about the plot was that they were invited to a big mansion. Throughout the book there a pictures that offer clues to solving the mystery. I can remember two pictures, one being a huge wrought-iron gate leading to the mansion (I think it was on the gate where ""midnight hour"" was written). The other picture I remember is the animals sitting around a table playing poker. Anyone know what book I'm talking about?
76625	book	jdoc-annotated	librarything	Hello, new member with a question. OK, two questions and a greeting. Hi, nice to meet you all. :) One question is about structure, the site just has a list of posts in my display, no set order, is that a fault of my set-up, or what you all see too?. Do posts come to the top page because they are used, sort of thing?. Basically, is there somewhere I can see how best to proceed?. Second question is, I read a fantasy novel recently, and could any of you guys identify it for me as it was quite good, and had sequels I would like to read. Female writer. Female protagonist. She discovers she is the lost heir to an alternate world, people of special bloodlines can move between the two worlds, ours and a more medieval one. People there live in castles, have a great fear of dimension hopping assassins. The ruling classes of the other world make a living by selling people there some of our technology, but pay for it all by running cocaine between the worlds. Each time one of the special people crosses between the worlds they are required to do a little mule work.
126140	book	jdoc-annotated	librarything	Mystery set in American Southwest / Female lead. Trying to remember the title of a book I read years ago - here's what I can recall: It was a fiction/mystery set in the southwest; the lead character was a woman, recently divorced and with a daughter of maybe about four; at some point in the beginning she and the daughter had applesauce for dessert at home; I don't think she was an actual detective or officer of any kind, just a woman caught in a mystery; she was kind of a loner and didn't have a sidekick; at some point she was being chased through the southwest landscape, trying to dodge someone. It wasn't really fast-paced and it wasn't humorous, but somewhat eerie, slow, quiet, and sort of noir. I want to say the book could be about 20 years old - I read it in the early-mid 2000's but it wasn't a new book at the time. I've tried doing tag searches and gone through tons of books but so far nothing quite fits. Thanks for any help - this is driving me crazy.

42109	book	jdoc-annotated	librarything	Children's picture book photographs feelings / family 1970s?. A book I grew up with that I'd really like to find ... Any suggestions appreciated! * Had the book from early-mid 1980s at least, although I do not recall when my family obtained it. * May talk about feelings in the story, and family, and could be part of a series as mentioned on the back cover. Series might be called something like ""How I feel"" or similar. I've tried searching many times to no avail. * The book had photographs throughout, all most likely in colour. Generally it was photo on one side, text on the other (reasonable amount of text, not just a tiny bit). * The book had a 1970s feel (clothing etc.), may have been published then. * The girl (main character) had long straight brown hair, very pretty, wore a red jumper, a (brown?) skirt as well. She carried a suitcase at one point. Her facial expression in one photo showed she was not happy with her parents -- the photo showed the girl standing with her back to camera, her parents in front of her facing the camera who have angry faces. * Another photo: the girl at the door of a house holding a suitcase, or maybe it's on the ground, and she is looking back at the camera. * The back cover could be red or orange or reddish-orange. The photo on the front cover, possibly an insert.
131548	book	jdoc-annotated	librarything	English Boy Thinks He Finds Eden. My girlfriend and I are trying to figure out the name of a book she read in high school several years ago. It was a novel about an English schoolboy having some sort of mental breakdown in the late 19th or early 20th Century. He starts to believe that his friend's mother is Eve, and her yard is literally the garden of Eden. It was very much a coming of age story about trying to find one's self in a world that tries to define you. Though she read it in high school, she does not think it was published for young adults. She does not remember when it was published, but is sure it was not new when she read it. What she does recall very clearly that the title was the name of the main character, and probably started with an 'h'. The cover was an image of the boy in his school uniform. Thanks in advance, folks!

50328	book	jdoc-annotated	librarything	Puzzle/mystery books, large format, late 80s. This is from a query on the ""Whatsthatbook.com"" site - I like the sound of the books and would not only love to answer the person's question, I'd like to find these books myself. Can anybody help? ""These books were nicely illustrated and had quite a dark theme. They told stories in which the reader was cast as protagonist (though there was no 'fighting fantasy' choice element as in ""turn to page 10 to go North, turn to page 11 to go South"""". Each page featured some sort of puzzle(s) and there were common puzzle themes running through the book. Often some sort of problem / cliffhanger would arise and there would be a question about how the character was going to proceed and overcome the problem. When you turned the page you'd find out whether you had guessed the right solution. One I recall as being about a run-down burlesque funfair, and some sort of evil plot involving poison gas hidden in light bulbs (one of the puzzles running through that book involved spotting the bulbs which contained the gas). The other book, in the same series, had a fantasy setting and the only puzzle I remember involved a question of where a character could hide having escaped from a castle into the surrounding moat, the answer being that he should use some reeds to form a snorkel to breathe through. My recollection is a fairly large format book.""
110636	book	jdoc-annotated	librarything	typewriter haunted by pulp writer. I read this around 1974-6 and it seemed like a new book at the time. Slim hardcover, can't remember what the dustjacket looked like, but I don't think it was pictorial. A struggling writer moves into a boarding house run by a large-bosomed and rather slovenly landlady. She gives him a typewriter to use, which turns out to be possessed by the previous owner's ghost. The ghost takes over and types out pulp-style adventures in various genres (exploration, detective, sword & sorcery) each involving a mysterious and voluptuous woman, and each missing the ending. The climax of the book is that the young writer pushes through to the ending of the story and discovers that the Amazon Queen he's questing for is the landlady, with whom the previous lodger was in love. It may have been written in the early 60s - I read TRIO: The Revolting Intellectuals Organization at about the same time, and it also looked like a new book. Both were in the Fraser Valley Regional Library System.
14641	book	jdoc-annotated	librarything	Looking for a title. An acquaintance of mine is looking for some help finding a title and I told him I'd post it on LT and see what we could come up with...below is his query...any ideas? As I write this, I'm watching Simon Schama's ""The Power of Art"" on WGBH. He's devoted an entire show to Van Gogh's ""Wheatfield with Crows."" I was reminded of a short story from one of the ""new horror"" anthologies published about a decade ago. The story is about an art historian who is attempting to understand the breakthrough event during Van Gogh's residency in Arles. The event has an alien/sfnal explanation that results in the narrator going insane in the same manner as as Van Gogh. The title is something like ""Orange is the Color of Paranoia, Blue is the color of Pain."" Google searches on almost any combination of the words in what I think is the title turn up hits for ""Orange Was the Color of Her Dress Then Silk Blues,"" the jazz classic by Charles Mingus. I'm stuck. Does anyone else know the title and author of the story I'm describing?
