Ok so this is really far fetched since I barely remember anything and what I do remember sounds like a typical fantasy story but I thought what the hell I might as well try finding it again.. So what I think I remember: It should be a part of a series, should be fantasy but maybe post apocalyptic? I remember there being a main girl and main boy characters who she either meets or they are sibilings? I think there is this big desert, aaaaaand something about Amber? OH and maybe some sort of Wind Instrument.. or has to do with some Wind maybe? (But not Name of the Wind..) Oh and the cover or something in the book is maybe about a sculpt? something sculpted out of wind and sand maybe? The beginning might involve some big machine or something carrying one of the characters to this big city? Maybe with a lot of other kids? She might also be an orphan (and the boy, if he is her brother).

Mostly because it was unrealistic but it was so long ago I don’t remember the title. It was about a young woman who was in between jobs and not really sure what she wanted to do for her career. She was hired to work in a mansion by the housekeeper(maybe) to organize or something and was warned to stay away from the owner of the mansion. It wasn’t expanded upon as to why she needed to stay away so she didn’t really take it seriously. It turns out that the owner of the mansion has a “voracious appetite” and when around women he can’t control himself. At one point she hides in the closet while he is showering and he swears that he can smell “pussy” and goes on the hunt for it but gets distracted. At one point they do meet face to face but he pretends he is the gardener for some reason. At this point I stopped reading.

It did have some pictures. It starts off with him meeting a bear who teaches him how to survive in the woods, specifically what to eat and what not to eat. I seem to remember a picture of a pear-looking thing that looked a bit saggy. The boy gets comfortable and at one point he has the thought of how it was hard for him to sleep with such a large animal before, but now he couldn't imagine sleeping without the large heaving breaths. Perhaps the bear was a bugabear? The bear dies because he is eaten by puffballs with mouths and the kid survives thanks to the bear's sacrifice. The boy then goes and finds a...beehive maybe? I remember he almost drowned in the honey while trying to get some and then he had to escape the hive. After that the book gets really foggy. I seem to remember sky pirates and the Quote (maybe not direct): ""I wonder what adventures lead to the kink in his blade"" and the kid really wanted to come with. He was denied passage on the ship. I seem to remember the end was a city handing off the edge of the cliff and a bucket he rode down into the fog. I believe he also wanted to or did fly a hot air balloon into the clouds beyond the city. I do not remember if the book was popular or good, so it may be a series that a lot of people read or a book I only found and the series was not finished.",1,,,,

99,8o78da,tipofmytongue,[TOMT][BOOKS]Looking for the source of these two scary stories. Highly likely that they're from kid's scary story collections. Remember reading them in the mid-late 90s to early 2000's.,3,8o78da,1,2018-06-03 10:17:34,halikadito,"I'm not sure of they were in the same book or not. It's entirely possible that I'm remembering two stories from different collections, because short horror story anthologies were my bread and butter when I was growing up. * Story #1: A first person narrative from the point of view of a young person. They are in a hospital bed, either in an actual hospital or their own home. The adults are all watching the news and nervously talking to each other in another room. There are police around, and people are wondering if they've caught someone yet. Turns out, the person the police are looking for is the father of a boy that died recently. The father kind of lost his mind, and started tracking down the people that received his son's donated organs. He took someone's eyes because they received a cornea transplant from his son, etc. The reason everyone was so worried about the kid in the hospital bed was because they had received the dead boy's heart, and the father of the dead boy was on the loose, and probably going to come after them. I remember the narrator saying something like ""Everyone was scared... because you see... I got [the dead boy]'s heart."" * Story #2: A ""wishes come true but they go horribly wrong"" story. I don't remember many details about this one. A boy wishes a school bully would get ripped to shreds. Somehow, the bully ends up falling into a tiger(?) pit at the zoo. I can't remember if the boy makes any other wishes between the bully wish and his last wish. His last wish involved his cat. He wished, for some reason, that it could be big enough to defend itself(?). Cue the cat turning into a giant beast. The huge cat-beast traps the boy in his bathroom. If I remember correctly, the story ends with the cat-beast breaking down/scratching through the bathroom door. Hoping these will ring a bell for someone. They've been rolling around in my brain for years. Thanks for any help you can offer!",1,,,,

When I was in my preteens my mum bought me an Enid Blyton compilation-type book. I devoured that book over the course of a week and bits and pieces of those tales have always stuck with me; idk if anyone else has experienced this but I'll remember a scene from those stories suddenly and I'll just get the same thrill and shiver I felt when I first read those words. Anyway that specific book was lost to life quite some time ago, and apart from some specific parts and the feelings, I've forgotten most of the details about the stories and every now and again when those memories strike I'll trawl the internet in a crazed state trying to track down the name of those stories like that dude from that movie Memento. Herewith the hazy details of what I can remember: 1. There were definitely a bunch of kids having adventures in the stories - OBVIOUSLY. But I can confidently say it wasn't a Secret Seven, Famous Five or one of those tree book series. 2. I distinctly remember these kids pretty much going all Primitive Technology and building a house out of saplings and trees and mud in the middle of this one forest at some point in one story. This is probs one of the greatest impressions the story left on me at the time as I remember thinking just how baller it would be to make my own house out of trees (I was super into Tarzan and Mowgli at the time too lol). What's important is that there was one kid in the story that was distinctly better than all the others at this Bear Grylls stuff and he basically took on the barkitechture for the group. There was this whole paragraph about how he bent the tops of the saplings to form a roof for the house and then mudproofed it and it was just great to read as a kid. I think this kid's name was Jack or John or something with a J. 2. Another detail I can remember is a different story (I think) in the compilation with a valley, and there was this cave with a huge ugly statue in it with a secret tunnel behind it. Bandits and/or robbers (might've been both tbh) knew about this tunnel and were using it for some dastardly deeds and the kids found out about it and made like pesky kids do. I remember this pretty distinctly coz I remember wishing I was the one that found the entrance to the tunnel haha. That's about as much as I can recollect tbh. It's a lazy Sunday here and whilst chilling and smoking a blunt these memories decided to surface once more, so I thought I'd try my luck outchea on Reddit and see if any internet strangers can help put an end to my 12 year Enid ennui 😂",1,,,,

It was published by either SportsIllustrated or ESPN the Mag and it was a collection of columns written by a guy whose job it was to research age-old questions and mysteries about sports and call people and interview them to try to find an answer. The guy who worked for SportsIllustrated/ ESPN went by a pseudonym because I feel like I remember that his real name was a ""highly protected secret"" or something like that. It was important that he retained a certain level of anonymity for some reason. I remember some of the questions including-- -Why is the first baseman not included in the toss around the horn? -Is baseball really based on cricket/ football's relationship to bowling, etc. I don't think that every question had to do with baseball, it's just that I grew up playing a lot of baseball so those are the ones I paid the most attention.

The main kid's family only grew the three sisters (corn, beans, and squash), so he was really intrigued by the neighbour's yard.

They had a horizontal layout, approx 4"" tall x 6"" wide and each story was about 40 pages. Each page had a large, beautiful black and white illustration somewhat similar in style to [Aubrey Beardsley](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Aubrey_Beardsley#/media/File:Beardsley-peacockskirt.PNG) with text at the bottom. The stories all had a rather dark feel, usually involving a naive maiden inveigled by a dishonest man with magical powers. I remember two in particular, one called 动物王 about a girl who thinks she's married a prince but he's actually turned all his lovers into animals; and another about a man with a magical bag that could conjure food and trap people inside for beatings.

When the aliens were shot, they would turn into little balls of light that would float up. Towards the end of the book, the kids were able to find the aliens' breeding grounds and were planning to blow it up to get rid of them once and for all. That's when we find out that every time an alien was shot, each of those little balls of light would then turn into another alien.

The tracker and his companions follow some tracks up to an open ridge, where suddenly he realised it's a trap.

I read the second or third book in this series when I was around 8 (2003/2004ish). It was about a boy who had started learning about magic and stuff from some kind of sorcerer/wizard, and was set a few centuries ago. There was no electricity and characters were poor. In this time, there were witches who were persecuted by “normal” people. People could tell who the witches were because they all wore pointed shoes. The boy had a friend who was a witch, and I think her name was Alice. All of the books were named “the sorcerer’s/wizard’s/something’s _____” and was written showing the boy’s experiences. I think it was written in third person. The cover of the particular book I read was navy blue, with the title and some kind of simple drawing in gold foil. Each of the books were different colours (red and green are colours I distinctly remember). The texture was kind of bubbly/rough, I’m not sure how to describe it but I really enjoyed the feel of it because it wasn’t smooth like most books.

It featured a young man who would go on expeditions around the world with others (they might have been his family, I don't remember). I can remember a few parts of some of the books, for example: * In one book they go to some Pacific island (it might have been Tonga or something). There's a scene where they do this ""sand bath"" where they get buried to the neck in hot sand (kinda like a dry hot tub). The protagonist remarks that it's uncomfortably hot at first, then he relaxes and it feels great. * In another (it might have been the same book, not sure) they're at sea and they can see a plume of smoke (from a volcano?). The protagonist asks how far away it is and his companion says around 200 miles. The protagonist protests that nobody can see that far, but then his companion points out that the stars are ""millions of miles"" away. * The last scene I can remember is they're in a hot air balloon (different book in the series, I think), and there's a cyclone. The protagonist's friend says this particular cyclone is so crazy because they're on the equator and the cyclone can't spin either clockwise or counterclockwise. That's all I remember. I don't know if it's a children's series or YA officially. I remember liking them quite a lot, but my teachers in middle school didn't want me reading them because they weren't ""challenging"" enough. So pretty simple reading for a pre-teen. Thanks!",1,,,,

There's at least 2 books in the series, not sure if there's a 3rd. I remember the cover of one of the books was a cute cartoon style of the school/town with lots of green mist or something. It's a female protagonist who has a younger sister and attends this school (not sure if boarding school or not) for either witches or just people with magical powers in general. There are mystery kidnappings of children disappearing and I think she starts getting involved when her sister went missing. The only other thing I remember was that they went to the basement of the school or another big building and it had to do with some Halloween ritual and those children being sacrificed, or otherwise being used for something (maybe sacrificing is too dark for a children's book haha). I think there was some weird dancing involved? Sorry if that isn't much to go on or if I got some details wrong, it's all I remember :( Thanks in advance!",1,,,,

It might have even been a short series but I don't recall. The Story took place in giant machines that traveled the earth and people lived on them. But they weren't moving cities like in the trailer. The Story takes place in the UK's Version of these giant machines because each country had their own. And the nobles lived in the upper levels of these giant machines and the engineers/workers live near the bottom in slums and are treated poorly. And the giant machines are shown to destroy nature and even villages that get in their path as they travel the world but no one seems to notice or care I think in the story a girl from the lower deck meets a boy in the upper levels who is like the son a noble. They somehow Travel together throughout the story and fall in love like most other young adult books. And in the end they expose the leader/captain of the giant machine as corrupt, the boy I think became the new captain and convinces the other huge machines to drive in the ocean to protect the nature and villages from their giant wheels/treads (even though that probably would still damage nature) and the workers don't have to live in the slums/engine rooms anymore.

Apologies in advance if it's not the best explanation. When I was in middle school, one of our teachers read to us from this sort of mystery book that was all about lateral thinking. The book had a whole bunch of short stories where one character would recount a personal experience and it was the reader's job to find an inaccuracy in this story. Kind of like the book version of Phoenix Wright if that helps. The one example I remember is there was a story (I think it was a murder mystery) about a person in Louisiana in the winter. They tell their story in front of a judge, and after thinking it over, the judge has an ""a ha"" moment and pronounces them guilty. The inaccuracy in the story was that the person described Louisiana as having a lot of mosquitoes when they were there, but Louisiana actually has no mosquitoes in the winter (or something to that end). Now that I'm a teacher, I've been doing a lot of lateral thinking stuff with my students.

I'm looking for a book that I read in probably 5th or 6th grade but it was definitely published way before I read it, probably in the 90s or early 2000s, maybe even the late 80s? The main character is a late middle school or early high school student and her family either just moved to a new area or she had to switch schools and she shadowed another student (who may have been in early high school, this student was taking trig as a math class). The two girls get close but I think the friend ends up dying one night because she got hit by a car? She may have died close to or around if not on Halloween. The main character is having a really tough time dealing with it, but realizes her friend would want her happy and she ends up having to take trig and always thinks of her. I am also pretty sure they lived in an apartment building. Those are the details that I know were in that book, the following I swear are but might not be. I know the main character was going to a Halloween party or dance, maybe at school, and got her period for the first time and stained her costume. She was dressed up like a gypsy or a genie, I remember her being a genie better. Her father was the only one home and she didn't want to talk to him about it, so she went to an elderly neighbor who helped her clean up and told her that when she was young, she ""rode horses, swam, and just did everything she normally did"". I remember her father later telling her that she could come to him about it, and the elderly neighbor being somewhat of a confidant? Her family might have had to move for financial reasons, maybe because her father lost his job? I think she had a way older sibling, maybe a sister and possibly a younger brother, but I am not sure about the younger sibling.",1,,,,

I think it took place in the Old West; the main character was a girl with red hair who either ran away from home or maybe her parents died. She thought she wouldn't be safe living as a girl so she cut off her hair with a rusty knife. I remember one scene where she's taken in by a frontier woman; she drops a ball of yarn and something about how she catches (or doesn't catch?) the ball of yarn has the woman realize that she's a girl. Later, after her hair grows out again, I believe she gets a haircut from another woman who (believing the character to be a boy) comments that curly red hair is wasted on a boy. Late in the book there's a timeskip to many years later; the main character (even as an adult) still lives as a man. At some point she lost an eye after being kicked by a horse, so she has to wear an eyepatch; having a somewhat messed-up face helps to make a more convincing illusion of being a man.

On the way, he met Laius, with whom he quarreled, fought, and killed. Although he did not know it at the time, Laius was the father of Oedipus. When he neared Thebes, Oedipus came across the Sphinx, a ferocious beast with the head and bust of a woman, and the body of a big cat (usually a lion). The Sphinx had effectively put Thebes under siege, by refusing to let anyone past unless they successfully answered her riddle. Those who failed were killed, possibly by being flung from the nearby cliff, although some appear to have ended up providing the Sphinx with her next meal instead. The riddle of the Sphinx was: “Which creature has one voice and yet becomes four-footed, two-footed, and three-footed?” SPOILER ENDED (copied from https://eclecticlight.co/2017/05/28/the-psychology-of-the-riddle-oedipus-and-the-sphinx/ and I can't get the spoiler format sorry) Also, this is a repost because I posted on the wrong subreddit previously.",1,unsolved,,,

Here's the story: In the beginning of the book, a little girl brings her plush rabbit on a boat/cruise. Some older boys take her plush rabbit and start tossing it around to each other, and one of them accidentally throws it over the edge of the boat. The rabbit gets tangled up on a fishermans hook and he brings it out of the water. The fisherman gives the plush to his son (?) and then he gives it to his little sister, who's really sick and coughing up blood. I don't remember what happens next, but the plush rabbit eventually ends up at an antique store. The girl who originally owned the plush is an adult now.

I just remembered reading a book when I was younger and I can't for the life of me remember what it or any of its subsequent books were called. Here's what I remember of the plot: There is a virtual war going on between 2 world super powers as a way to settle the ownership of a newly discovered island. Most of the world is irradiated due to a nuclear war that forced everyone to live in climate controlled domes. The new island is discovered to be the first place on Earth to be free of radiation since the bombs fell. So, the nations raise their team of 2 champions from birth to play this virtual game. The main protagonist is a boy that is raised by an AI that serves as his parental figure and teaches him everything he knows about the world. The other member of his team is a girl who rejects the brainwashing of the AI and is kind of a rebel. They work together but lose to the other team but it turns out that they cheated so the protagonists win the island. Their reward is to live on the island and that is how the first book ends. I remember some of the other plot for the second? or third? book as well if that would help. This wasn't too recent maybe before 2013? More like 2008-2012 was when I read it and it was fairly new then.",1,,,,

So about two months ago on 4/21, I was in a bookstore in Portland (Powell's) near their poetry section, and I found a memoir located right next to a copy of Babysitter At Rest by Jen George. I picked it up, but it haunted me too much to buy. Two months removed, I've been searching for it and haven't achieved any success. I was wondering if you guys could help! Here's what I remember about the book; -Author was non-binary and Asian. Last name might be Kim from what I remember, but I may be incorrect. -There was a character in a leather jacket named Bryan. -A page or two about diabetes. -I think a miscarriage/abortion was mentioned. That's what I remember, but thank you guys so much if you know what it is or not!",1,unsolved,,,

Maybe by describing it it'll trigger someone on here as this has haunted me for close to 2 years now to no avail. The book is about 2 brothers who own a failing fire wood company in New Mexico up in the mountainous region of the state. One is a former marine who lost his leg below the knee the younger brother is a young hot head with big dreams of grandiose. The older former marine brother has a girlfriend who is the daughter of the local sheriff in town. The sheriff is a coke addict to the extreme with a deputy who is some bum he can manipulate to his desires as well. I believe he drove around in a cop car with the American flag on all over it very distinguishable. The sheriff was corrupt and worked for a cartel drug leader located in New Mexico. The cattle drug lord was a gay dancer that had an affinity for recreating scenes from famous plays and ballets with other dancers in his spare time as well as having his guards parading around in nothing but their skivy's and see thru material. The 2 brothers stumbled apon a outdoor grow operation and the younger brother kills the gay drug lords nephew who was watching the crop up in the mountains and they steal the crop which leads to the unfolding of a great series of events to jumps to a great conclusion to the story. If any of this rings a bell please help end my quest and satisfy my hunger to re-read this great story. Edit: solved thanks again,1,,,,

I had it as a child and remember reading the beginning but never really getting into it. Friends at school or something like that.... I know it did have a storyline of like something happening at the school meanwhile these goblins were intruding into the world, a school dance I want to say, but I'm not entirely sure of the specificity of that. But I don't remember the book for the story. The cover is what stayed with me after all these years of just having it in my memory. This is all coming from memory so I might be wrong, but I'll give it my best shot. The cover didn't use a lot of colors but it showed a forest, you couldn't see much of it (the author might've used yellow? to depict fog), but there were numerous trees here and there. I don't know if they all had the same thing happening but the most prominent tree (it might've been a bit off center) had a goblin's arm or head for that matter (now this was a bright but creepyish green) coming out of the tree hollow. Now that I think about all the trees had hollows in their centers. It was a very creepy cover for such a lighthearted book (well, that's being compared to what I read anyways.) I could swear the name of the book was something like goblins in the woods or goblins in the trees or something that pertained to what we were seeing on the cover. Oh and if it helps, this book could've been released anyway from late 90's to 2002,2003,2004ish? The cover of the book that I'm trying to find sort of does the same cover of this book: https://images.gr-assets.com/books/1347224970l/5185742.jpg - specifically the colors behind the goblin in that the colors used for the trees are darker than the colors used for the air around them.

She remembers reading it in hardback. It was about a girl who went to a summer camp (possibly in northern Indiana, probably Midwest) and her adventures there. She got into some trouble, but nothing very threatening and everything was happily resolved. The girl would have been 9\-12 years old (the book was targeted to the same\-aged readers). She always wore her hair in braided pigtails, and never took them out to wash, until her hair got so dirty/moldy/tangled they had to cut her pigtails off. There were also some mentions of Native American tribes, but the customer doesn't remember there being Native American characters.

(i'm 17 now, so it wasnt too long ago) i don't remember too much about it but i've been looking for years and years but i just cant seem to find it. was hoping someone on here may know what book i'm talking about x okay so the book was about a young girl who moved to maine (i think) and in with (i believe) some extended family members. i don't remember the exact reason for the move, so sorry. but while she was there, there was one specific room that her family wouldn't let her go into. it was completely off limits. every once in a while, though, notes would slide out from under the door of the restricted room. i don't remember what the notes were about but i know that she would always take the notes whenever she'd find them. i have no idea how the book ended, unfortunately. again, i clearly don't remember much about the book and it was an elementary school level book so there wasn't much of a plot to begin with. thought i would just run it by here as a last resort before i finally give up on finding it. fingers crossed someone can help me out!!",4,,,,

Not sure how helpful that is but there's a chance. The story itself is about a being that falls to earth and if found by the US government. I'm not sure if its stated or just alluded that the being is an angel. There's a scientist with the government that examines the body (I think the angel is dead) and the government is also about to run nuclear tests I think. The Soviets (I think) also found a similar being and its revealed that their scientist performed an autopsy and then killed himself and I believe destroyed the reports. The remains were attached to a bomb being tested. I think it's the US that also find a book, or maybe the angel had some message, and it was one word: peace. I think. I want to say it was something to that effect. I've thought about the story for years but I cannot for the life in me remember the name or the author, but the plot had stuck in my mind.

The story had a comedic tone, nothing serious up until the end where the protagonist gave up one of his hearts for a girl in a disaster(if I remember correctly).

1276,8rn096,tipofmytongue,"[TOMT] [BOOK] A book, an excerpt of which was included in the Washington state Smarter Balanced ELA test",7,8rn096,1,2018-06-17 01:03:32,NoveTheGreat,"In either 7th (2013-2014 academic year) or 8th grade (2014-2015), a book on the Smarter Balanced ELA (English/Language Arts) test caught my eye. (For information on SBAC and other standardized testing in WA, look [here](http://www.k12.wa.us/smarter/default.aspx) and [here](http://www.k12.wa.us/assessment/StateTesting/).) Now, I may have some of these details wrong, as it was four or more years ago, and I have ADHD and all the memory problems that come with it. Bearing that in mind, these are all the things I think I remember about this book. * The author was female (I'm only ~60% sure about this one) * The main character was a young boy named Ry. (I am 100% certain of this; the reason the passage first caught my interest was because I have a character of my own who is also named Ry.) * The book had won some kind of prize or medal (either Nobel or Pulitzer, I think). * The title included something like ""The Edge of the World"" or ""The End of the World."" * The passage that was used in the test described Ry climbing a slope(?) of some kind near a train station in the middle of an enormous empty field. He was alone, and he might have had some kind of amnesia. He wanted to catch a train to try and get home, but none had come, so he'd decided to try and find water (I think). A train approached and he tried to run back to catch it, but his foot got caught on a root and he tripped (I believe he hurt his ankle doing this). * He might have been thinking about a parent throughout the scene, I'm not 100% certain That's about all I can remember. Thanks a bunch in advance; the book seemed really good just from reading that passage, and I've wanted to read the whole thing all these years.",1,,,,

I remember very little about it. It was set in the Arctic, and a group of explorers got lost and ended up living with some Inuit for a while. I think it was set in the 1800s-ish, because I think it was the first time the explorers ever met Inuit and vice versa. I remember there was a lot of explorers sleeping with Inuit ladies, and something about one of the explorers teaching a girl how to kiss. I'm also pretty sure something violent went down around the end, and several people were killed? Sorry I have so little info about it, I read it 15+ years ago and just remembered about it.",1,,,,

I think she runs away with her best friend pet donkey, who decided he wants to stay, i think? She ends up in the desert searching for an oasis and finds a caravan led by a woman who gives her peppermint tea. She goes to a big kingdom and is told that the king will take her as one of his many wives as soon as she gets her period. She befriends a servant. She wakes up with stomach pains one morning and thinks she might have been poisoned so she calls in the servant and it turns out she got her period so she needs to hide it. She goes and talks to the moon goddess at a lake in a cave. The goddess tells her she has great power within her and to be her true self. At the end i remember people were coming after her (her dad? The king?) and she dug deep within herself to channel the earth and attacked them with vines. Its the first one of a trilogy but the second and third books hadn't come out when i first read it. I found the name a year or two ago and promptly forgot it. I've tried googling it but it's not coming up. You can surely understand how being able to remember so much about a book/series but not its title or author. Help would be much appreciated",1,,,,

1475,8s27uo,tipofmytongue,"[TOMT][Book Series] A series of books about teens in highschool, with an overarching plot but each book focuses on 1 person and their problem.",1,8s27uo,1,2018-06-18 21:20:46,vanade,"I read a book series many years back that I can't for the life of me identify now, no internet search has ever helped me pin it down. (we're talking like, maybe 14 years ago, but I also got a lot of my books used so I doubt it was published exactly at that time) There were multiple teenagers in this series, each with their own personal issue they were dealing with. Off the top of my head, the two I remember most strongly are a boy who struggles with taking his ADHD meds, which make him uncreative and stifle his personality, and a girl whose parents each want her to go to different Ivy league schools. One of her parents wants her to pursue music, and I forget what the other wanted. At one point she's so stressed out while writing her SATS that she gets a straight 0--she doesn't even write her name. So anyway, each book kind of focusses on a character like this, but they're all tied into an overarching series so the characters make cameos in each other's books. There might've been 5-7 books. Anyone have any idea what book series this was? I never finished them so I just want to be able to know how it ends for each of them!",1,unsolved,,,

So all I can really remember was that throughout the book, you would shift perspectives to the killer, and I remember one of the times the killer got excited and pissed themselves, and they identified the killer as a female because of the traces of blood found in it.. There was something to do with a ginger beard hair or something that belonged to her ex-husband or something who may or may not have been a famous writer (not sure if that was anything or not).. I feel like I've read this book and it's been constantly nagging at me that I can't even remember the name of it, just how they identified the killer..

It's a fragment from the end of the book and only makes sense later. * Pretty sure it had a female main character, or at least a prominent one. * It also tells a side story about one of the female students who does some shady stuff to get money. * It's winter near the end of the book, and there's a heavy snowstorm.

1548,8s8qbh,tipofmytongue,[TOMT][book] Australian picture book of the Kokoda track(?) for kids (attempt two),3,8s8qbh,1,2018-06-19 15:09:38,Thegoodthebadandaman,"It's a standard large picture book meaning that almost, if not all, the entire area of each page is completely covered in a single illustration each with the actual words on overlaid on them if I remember correctly. The illustrations are also all paintings, maybe oil. I saw in my Australian(Sydney specifically) public primary school library meaning that it was all least around pre-2012. It also meant that it was somehow considered suitable for kids around 12/13 years old at the most despite what the book was about. It depicted a young black native boy at the start of the book living in a relatively lush forest area. It also at some point depicted a group of Australian soldiers fighting in the forest outnumbered and attempting to fight and retreat from Japanese forces. At some point near the end of the book the boy stumbles upon a heavily injured relatively young Australian soldier who was somehow left behind, covered in bloodied bandages, and couldn't even really walk. The boy tried to help (I think) but due to the grave injures it's quite apparent the soldier isn't going to make it. I believe there was a reoccurring motif of a (blue?) butterfly throughout the book and at that specific point the butterfly lands on the young digger. The digger then dies right at the same moment as the butterfly lifting off and it starts to fly up through the trees into the (night?) sky, to represent the digger's soul going to heaven I guess. Although I don't remember it being mentioned specifically I have reason to believe the book was staged in New Guinea during WW2, and was most likely about the Kokoda Track Campaign and the assistance of natives to Australian forces in particular. edit: the helpful natives were nicknamed ""I saw in my (Australian) primary school library meaning that it was all least around pre-2012. edit: the helpful natives were nick-named ""Fuzzy Wuzzy Angels"" by Australian troops.

All these boys at her school (including her boyfriend) started running insanely-high temperatures, having leaking, bloody eyes and becoming aggressive and violent---or else just collapsing, seizing and dying. She went home to find that her father has beaten her mother to death so she takes her younger sister and runs. Then it cuts to three years later. She's a scout for the all-female outpost she lives at. They have rings of defenses; the surviving males behave more like pack animals than human beings, and have also evolved to become huge, hulking behemoths of muscle and seemingly only-barely sentient. Any female they happen upon will be brutally torn apart. Their doctor/researcher takes specimins the girl has captured and cages and injects them with substances she hopes will provide a cure (but actually just kill them, thus far) but not before giving each one a name, a backstory, and one particular thing that makes him special---'he was teaching himself to play the guitar' 'he loves dogs' 'his kids were his whole world' etc. There's also glimpses at life in the outpost, straight women adjusting to life with no men, little girls growing up in disbelief that kissing/marrying boys was a thing that ever happened, gay women just fine with the new normal, etc. Oh, and of course at one point the protagonist encounters the only immune male that may actually exist, and tries to keep him secret from the others who want to experiment on/kill him.

In it, the main character (M) was telepathic. In this world, telepaths, or people with similar abilities, were marked by a tattoo or something similar on their pinky finger. IIRC it was almost like a racoon's tail, with alternating stripes of two different colours and the colours were different based on the ability (i.e. Telepaths might get green and yellow while empaths got blue and red or something. I don't remember the exact colours, though). In the story, this main character somehow ended up purchasing a slave girl who was bred to not have thumbs (or maybe they were cut off) because he didn't like how she was treated by her master, then to give her freedom, he married her, but she didn't understand freedom and stayed with him. The two of them ended up going on a mission into space to find an alien ship and communicate with it, but the telepath finds he can't, even with telepathy, but it turns out that his wife can because she's an empath who can project her emotions so she communicates with the aliens with emotions. Then the story changes to focus on a group of scientists or something exploring a boggy, swampy planet (and I think they may have crashed there) and that's when I stopped reading. I don't know why I stopped reading and it's bothered me ever since. I can't remember the names of any of the characters or the book or author and I've been looking for it for years so I can finish it. Thanks to anyone who knows what book it is.",1,unsolved,,,

He revels he's the killer and he burned the man through the side of the house and he was going to kill her with the same device (Wish I knew the name of it) and he talks about killing because he can and he's a special person and theres more like him. Thats what I can remember , It'd be greatly appreciated if anyone can help :), Thank you!!",1,,,,

It sounds like something he'd write. If it's not him, try Intensity, and Dragon Tears out, I don't even like those types of books, but I think they're good anyway. Life Expectancy is my favorite, but that doesn't really fit into the Mystery Thriller genre.",1,unsolved,,,

She was definitely a super rich girl who just got whatever she wanted, and there was drama surrounding this whole thing. I don't know why I'm remembering it now but I was just curious if anyone knows who I am thinking about. I think she was blonde. Her fantasy novel series had a super cliche title.",2,not KI,,,OP is looking for an author

And the main character was some kind of young chosen savior. And at the end the main character(s) confront the enemy in a completely empty town. Either the enemy made everyone disappear or the town was some kind of construct....not sure. Sorry I dont have that much info. - I grew up in a bad neighborhood with a bad school. But in 6th grade I moved to a better area with a good school. I remember being shocked at having an actual fun book to read and students that actually liked something at school. So I just wanna find the book to have a copy for the memory.,1,,,,

Google usually helps me find them, but this one is stumping me. It starts with a young girl exiting a building to a little secluded, grassy area. The building might have been a school or old folk's home. She finds a girl her age, who introduces herself as a future queen of some country. I remember the main girl being incredulous and announcing the she's the future president of the United States in reply. The ""princess"" feels she's being mocked, but they become friends and I believe they keep meeting in the same grassy area and play board games over a summer. I think I read this sometime between '89-'91.",1,unsolved,,,
