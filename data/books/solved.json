An orphaned girl lives happily with her Aunt until one day the Aunt marries some really creepy man. They go to live in his house where he has three daughters from his first marriage. These daughters never leave the house or go to school and the man has brainwashed the Aunt into his way of thinking, which I think is some weird cross between an extreem religion and a desire to protect and control his children. The girl wants a normal life and tries to escape, even to the point of getting out and begging the neighbours to help her but the Aunt and Uncle catch her and tell the neighbours she is mentally disabled and not to pay her any attention. Eventually the middle daughter (who I think is called Helen) becomes caught up in the girl's description of real life, friends, school etc and agrees to help her. The girl pretends to be coming around to the Uncle's way of thinking and is eventually allowed to leave the house in the company of his daughters. They go jogging late at night for exercise with a cover story of looking for a lost puppy. This is how the girl and Helen escape.
