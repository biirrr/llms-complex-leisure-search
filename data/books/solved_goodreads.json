She is kind of an intellectual - her father may have been a poor scholar. Her new husband isn't, and is just happy to get a beautiful wife. She refuses to let him consummate the marriage on the first night, locking herself in a separate room.\n\nHer father in law doesn't want her hair cut after she's married (which is traditional for Jewish women).\nShe starts out hating her husband, but they fall in love.\nThey start to build a life together; she is a seamstress and I think her husband is a farmer.\n\nAt some point in her early marriage, she is pregnant and is trying to make money, so she talks to a rich gentile woman, who likes her dresses -- the dresses help to hide her pregnancy so she can be in public.\n\nThe father in law becomes more and more obsessed with her, and eventually tries to r*pe her, which is stopped.\n\nThey deal with pogroms by Russians, and build a life together. They have a son (maybe also named David?) who looks like his father -- big and blond.\n\nThe son is a cocky jerk, who at some point kills a man in a fight. The son looks a lot like his father, so his father takes his place when he is supposed to be hanged. The son then flees to America.\n\nThe son doesn't understand English, and people at Ellis Island change his last name to \"von XYZ\" because having \"von\" is a marker of nobility and they are making fun of him.\n\nHe lives in America for a while, and eventually meets a Jewish girl with a strict father. He falls in love with her and the girl teaches him how to behave and learn as an Orthodox Jewish man; when he approaches the father to marry the girl, the father sees through it and sends him away.\n\nEventually the son becomes very successful. Maybe he owns a department store?\n\nI think he meets a slightly older spinster and starts to sleep with her, and I think she tricks him into marrying her by pretending to be pregnant. They have an \"ok\" marriage and eventually have a daughter who he loves and spoils.\n\nHis daughter grows up not knowing about her Jewish heritage; she's rich and spoiled and eventually starts hanging around American Nazi sympathizers before the start of World War 2 (I don't remember if the book had a lot of focus on WW1).

She is kind of an intellectual - her father may have been a poor scholar. Her new husband isn't, and is just happy to get a beautiful wife. She refuses to let him consummate the marriage on the first night, locking herself in a separate room.\n\nHer father in law doesn't want her hair cut after she's married (which is traditional for Jewish women).\nShe starts out hating her husband, but they fall in love.\nThey start to build a life together; she is a seamstress and I think her husband is a farmer.\n\nAt some point in her early marriage, she is pregnant and is trying to make money, so she talks to a rich gentile woman, who likes her dresses -- the dresses help to hide her pregnancy so she can be in public.\n\nThe father in law becomes more and more obsessed with her, and eventually tries to r*pe her, which is stopped.\n\nThey deal with pogroms by Russians, and build a life together. They have a son (maybe also named David?) who looks like his father -- big and blond.\n\nThe son is a cocky jerk, who at some point kills a man in a fight. The son looks a lot like his father, so his father takes his place when he is supposed to be hanged. The son then flees to America.\n\nThe son doesn't understand English, and people at Ellis Island change his last name to \"von XYZ\" because having \"von\" is a marker of nobility and they are making fun of him.\n\nHe lives in America for a while, and eventually meets a Jewish girl with a strict father. He falls in love with her and the girl teaches him how to behave and learn as an Orthodox Jewish man; when he approaches the father to marry the girl, the father sees through it and sends him away.\n\nEventually the son becomes very successful.

The acquaintance invites the man to sleep with his daughter.\n\nBook two is about a man who dies and goes to some equivalent of heaven, though called by some euphemistic name like perhaps 'the meadows.' People there are pretty quiet, shrouded in white, taking quiet walks. No life there. The man asks if there is any way he can return to life on earth. He is told that there is a way, but he cannot resume any of his earlier life. So I guess that this is a way of saying that he cannot 'go on' living - the being isn't really him. He finds himself as a bartender in an out of the way place.\"\n\nPlease provide a ranked list of your 20 best guesses for the correct answer.
