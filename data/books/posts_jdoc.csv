Then, there is also the book The Club Dumas by Perez-Reverte. It's not really a spy librarian, but it's about book collectors and mystery and murder.

20,47692,Central/Eastern European History,Histories of Jews in Eastern Europe or the Balkans,1,47692-1,1,"Oct 17, 2008, 10:00am",dlweeks,"My favorite book on this topic has to be Beyond Hitler's Grasp: The Heroic Rescue of Bulgaria's Jews. This might be because I have always been a bit partial to Bulgarian studies, but I think it shows the Jewish plight in an interesting light. In my mind it showed that not all of the countries allied with the Nazis were full of hateful people. This was a story of neighbor helping neighbor. Most importantly, it showed the government of Bulgaria's struggle to survive the Nazi war-machine but protect all of its citizens. Bar-Zohar does an excellent job with his research and I highly recommend this book to anyone wanting to know more about the Balkans, WWII, or even how some Jews were able to return to Palestine/Israel. Another book I enjoyed reading was The Bielski Brothers. It's a story of bravery, not just among the partisans but the people who took them in. It also delves into the humanity of the situation. It takes away the idea of numbers, which tend to numb the mind to what actually happened. The one thing that was a bit more disturbing about this book was the reaction of the Polish people. Some of them are so viciously anti-Semitic that it makes one sick. I have read a lot of Polish history and the reason Poland had such a large Jewish population at the time is due to it being historically Semite-friendly. Jews flocked to Poland to get away from oppressive regimes in France, England, Spain, Italy and so on. There are stories in this book about how average people stood up and risked their lives to help their neighbors.  What are some other readers' picks for this topic? Or anything remotely related I guess.",,320212|218389,not KI,,,topic

Aimed towards 2nd or 3rd grade reading level? It was, in general, one page of text, and one page of colored pictures. The pictures were quite vivid and brightly colored, and had a realistic style. The first page of each book would be all descriptions, I think. Talking about how beautiful the glade or whatever was. Setting the scene. I don't remember most of the plots. There was one about... horses, I believe. Maybe a horse that had no friends? I remember another one was about this cat that was very fat, and could not catch mice. One day a mouse comes along and helps the cat exercise, and the cat loses weight. It was a series, but the books did not share characters or anything. Like most children's books, they all had some sort of message. They were not that short. I don't think they had chapters, but they were not like those children books that only have one line of text per page. They were taller than a trade-paperback, and maybe around a centimeter thick.

Fanuilh and sequels by Daniel Hood has an amateur detective in a fantasy setting- Liam, a traveler and former soldier etc, inherits the familiar of a wizard acquaintance and has to solve the mystery of the wizard's murder in the first one. Shade and Shadow by Francine Woodbury is an academic fantasy setting, the chairman of the modern magic department is murdered and the main character/prime suspect, antisocial professor Raoul, has to clear his name. Randall Garrett's Lord Darcy series (starts with Too Many Magicians and continues in a couple of volumes of short stories. This is a fantasy/alternate history Sherlock Holmes pastiche. Michael Kurland continued the series after Garrett's death. (As a side note, Glen Cook's aforementioned Garrett, P.I. is named in honor of Randall Garrett.) Simon Green's Hawk & Fisher are hardboiled fantasy detectives. They have some backstory in one of his earlier books, a more typical fantasy, Blue Moon Rising. Green's books can get a little violent, which isn't personally to my taste. The books Steven Brust's Vlad Taltos series (starting with Jhereg) often have some mystery elements to the plot, but they aren't the focus. It's been a while since I read it, but I seem to remember that Patricia Wrede's Mairelon the Magician and sequel had some mystery elements. These are a kind of alternate-history Regency London with magicians. I had a little bit of a problem keeping track of the secondary characters too (the names seemed all quite similar). I seem to remember Shariann Lewitt's First and Final Rites having some mystery elements too, but I couldn't get into it at all- the characters seemed flat and infodumpy.",rosenbergjoel|wredepatriciac|greensimonr|kurlandmichael|garrettrandall|bruststeven|woodburyfrancine|hooddaniel|lewittshariann,26461|40371|46737|94815|366815|24778|268917|757142|170713,not KI,,,

It was a book about a white couple who decided to adopt a child, then ended up adopting a double-digit number of them over the course of the book with no thought to nationality or special needs.  I remember some specific scenes. One had the couple so poor that they were forced to eat a five-to-ten year-old decorative can of rattlesnake meat, opening it from the bottom so that they could wash it out and continue to display it. Also, there was a scene later in the book in which one of the couple's black daughters begged her parents to wash her skin until it was white like theirs. My mother or grandmother gave this to me, so I'm pretty sure it was intended for young adult or adult audiences. It had chapters, so I'm pretty sure it wasn't a children's book or teen fiction.

It is more or less an activity book which had a tablet-like-bookmark (made of card, of course, with dimensions roughly ~10x10 cm). The corners of this tablet-like-bookmark had bees on them, and about 5 holes to see through. Throughout the book there were hidden things we had to find by placing the tablet on each page, aligning the bees on the tablet to various coloured bees on the pages. The correct orientation of the tablet would reveal these hidden objects.  Usually each double page had 3 things we had to find: 1) Our next destination.  2) How to get there (either by road, river, bridge, etc.).  3) A small activity regarding that particular page. The book was not very long, about 30 pages or so but, it was very coulourfull. Enough to hide all the objects and markings. A few pages I can remember are: The Ravine, where a monster is in the ravine which you need to cross by walking on one of the two wooden bridges. One of the bridges has maggots in them and will break. So this is where you use the tablet, with the help of the bees, to know which bridge is safe to cross. Other pages include The Observatory, The Waterfall. Unfortunately I really can not remember the rest. This book was targeted at ages 5~9 (I guess). I would really appreciate it if anyone knew it. It was so much fun at the time, just wish to get my hands on it again and preserve it!

I truly cannot tell you how grateful I am...  Seriously, you made my day... I have been searching all over the web for it... Trying every iteration I could think of as a name! Again, thank you ever so much! There is just one other book I've been trying to find... It would be amazing if you knew that one too... Let me give a brief description: This book was paperback, black and white, was targeted at ages 10~15 (again, I'm guessing) and I remember reading it around 2002 (give or take a year)... It was about seeking a mysterious ghost haunting a mansion/castle (I cannot remember) where a deceased family lived... You start of at page one and have to solve each of the riddles/problems... You could end up with various answers, and depending on your answer, you are instructed to go to the respective page (to advance in the storyline, you need not read the pages in sequence)... For example you may be on a page with 3 gates drawn... Only after solving the riddle correctly will you know which the correct gate is (and hence the appropriate page number to turn to), in order to advance the story-line... The other gates may lead to dead-ends, death, etc... The book was filled with pictures (black and white), sometimes the riddles were picture related, and sometimes they were only text... All I can remember is that the ghost was an old lady (I think the family's grandmother). I don't exactly remember where she was hiding, but it was definitely either the catacombs or the place where plants were kept (not sure if the book called it a nursery)... But there was a trick to be able to see the ghost... You had to tilt the book almost horizontal to be able to see the old lady!  I hope you get the main gist of the book...

It was definitely written pre-1980, possibly much earlier. My gut instinct says written pre-1970. Definitely a pulp-style novel, similar to Lin Carter, ERB, E.E. `Doc' Smith, etc. What I MAY remember correctly or incorrectly: The two warring factions may be time travelers.

Her mom put the girl on a chair next to a doll and the woman thought they were concerned about the doll or something....like she didn't even see the girl or realize that was who they were talking about.

The plot is there's a coalition of various aliens some of which resemble ostriches others cat like they are fighting another species that humans later nickname squids anyway they come to earth and discover humans who they realize have a knack for war and actually seem to enjoy it and the humans end up turning the tide of the war ect .. I read it at least 15 years ago so pre 1995 and I also remember that the only species of the coalition of aliens that actually could even stand being in combat were the cat like ones . Another detail I remember is that they made gold from the ocean surrounding their ship and used it to pay the first test subjects to go to combat or combat school.

When the creatures came out of hibernation after their arrival all the adults in the colony were devoured and the only survivors were the children who were taking their classes inside the landed and partially cannibalized spacecraft that took them to that world. They were left alone with only the ship's AI to help them survive. The story is set just before the bugs are due to come out of hibernation for a second time.

It was a novel, about a monk in the medieval period (I think, I'm suddenly unclear about this) who was seeking to gather together the relics of St. Catherine. Possibly ended in a hermitage in Alexandria. The monk could hear her scattered body parts talking to him, but his order did not feel that he should be doing this, so some other group is maybe trying to stop him or collect her before he does? I'm fuzzy on this. I don't think it was marketed as a supernatural book, or a religious book, or a crime thriller, but more just a story/novel. It may have had the word Translation/Translated in the title (not referring to translation of the book, but the religious term of translation in terms of the removal of relics).

I probably read it around 2003-2005, when I read a lot of fanfiction as a happy outlet for my graduate school-deadened brain. The fic was futuristic dystopian, and the current slayer (not Buffy, but I don't think that was clear at the story's start) was living in the aftermath of some cataclysmic event. She found herself fighting fewer and fewer vampires, and it was only after she realized how long it had been since she'd last seen any person, even a vampire, that she realized the cataclysm had effectively killed off the human population and with it the vampire population had followed. The last line of the story paraphrased along the lines of, ""No... no... I can't be the... last!"" where it's made clear that the slayer isn't just the last of the slayers but the last living person on the planet. To make things more difficult, there is a chance this fic might have been one chapter of a multific, with each chapter exploring a different theme. :( My thought here are so vague it isn't even funny.

I want to say it had midnight or twilight (or something conveying the same idea) in the title, but I don't know if it was the book or series title I'm thinking of.  The plot was about a group of tabletop role playing gamers who go into a house to act out the adventure in a haunted house. They search the house for various key items to complete a ritual, and the closer it becomes to midnight, the more real the events turn. The spirits in the house are actually people who tried this ritual in the past and failed, and have used the rpg as a vehicle to try and free themselves by taking possession of the players.

Oh, and she does magic! She might live in a shop with her grandmother in a 'she taught her everything she knows' way. The boy might be called Jared or something like that? Towards the end he fights the villain who captured the girl. If I remember correctly, his parents died, possibly in a car crash. I think they meet in science class, possibly when the boy gets so angry that something blows up, and she heals him. And at one point they're in a cafe with classmates and he ignores her and she gets annoyed. Does that sound familiar to anyone?

I've been trying for some time to recall the title of a young adult sci-fi novel I read a long time ago. I think I must have read it between 1984 and 1987. It's about a world in which overpopulation has caused the creation of a system whereby people only get to live in the world one day a week. People go to sleep in a cryogenic state of some kind for 6 days a week, and then they wake up 1 day per week to live their lives. I think they call them Sleepers. A group of people, who are called Stoners for some reason, have found a way to skirt the system and live everyday but as a different ""person"". They have a different ""life"" each day, which allows them to wake every day. As I've searched for this book, I've thought that Time Stealers could be another phrase or keyword related to this book.

An orphaned girl lives happily with her Aunt until one day the Aunt marries some really creepy man. They go to live in his house where he has three daughters from his first marriage. These daughters never leave the house or go to school and the man has brainwashed the Aunt into his way of thinking, which I think is some weird cross between an extreem religion and a desire to protect and control his children. The girl wants a normal life and tries to escape, even to the point of getting out and begging the neighbours to help her but the Aunt and Uncle catch her and tell the neighbours she is mentally disabled and not to pay her any attention. Eventually the middle daughter (who I think is called Helen) becomes caught up in the girl's description of real life, friends, school etc and agrees to help her. The girl pretends to be coming around to the Uncle's way of thinking and is eventually allowed to leave the house in the company of his daughters. They go jogging late at night for exercise with a cover story of looking for a lost puppy. This is how the girl and Helen escape.

They then travel to a house of some sort where there are all four seasons in a day. As I remember it he loves it there then sinister undertones are revealed and the boy begins to miss his family. He tries to escape but everytime he goes through the gate it simply leads him back to the house through some sort of magic. In the end he escapes using some sort of rope or sling shot contraption.  It's really sad in the end because he only stays there for about 10 days but on the outside world that is equivalent to 10 years and his parents have put out missing persons posters and stuff and he has been missing for the whole time.

At some point he acquires this magic instrument, either an ocarina or flute, I think. Sorry, I know this isn't very good, but its been a long time since I read this.

It was about a girl who went on holiday to Wales (UK) and found a friendly dragon living in a cave on the beach. She brought him food (he was always hungry, usually a bun or something) and he told her his name so she could call him whenever she was in trouble. The best thing was though his name was never mentioned in the story, so it was a secret. Lots of adventures followed, although I can't remember any of them. I also recall something about not running around a rock three times anticlockwise because that would summon up a witch - which of course the little girl did and then had to be rescued.

(Don't you hate when that happens?) There were two alien species. One was very aggressive and drafted skilled workers from a more peaceful species onto large spaceships. The ships also had a population of the peaceful species that called themselves ship bred or ship born. The POV is mostly a ship born female. They used implants for inter-species communications. The very aggressive species set aside sections of the ship for raising their own young and were even unpredictable and explosively violent near that area. The female overlord-type running one ship drafted a technician, implanted him, paired him with the POV female of his species. Then she bought a human spacer out of lot of wild humans and added him to the group and ordered the other two to see if they could come to understand him. Along the way, there was a planetary invasion/destruction, because the humans had on it didn't immediately comply the demands of the overlord-types. The POV female discovered she was unable to function under an open sky. The implanted human insisted on rescuing a human child, much to the bafflement of the other two species. There was a rival ship, run by a male overlord-type, that also picked up some humans and wound up putting a mother and her child in the nesting area because they didn't have any children of their own species.

Cassandra was a character in mythology: In Greek mythology, Cassandra (Greek , also , also known as Alexandra) was the daughter of King Priam and Queen Hecuba of Troy. Her beauty caused Apollo to grant her the gift of prophecy. In an alternative version, she spent a night at Apollo's temple, at which time the temple snakes licked her ears clean so that she was able to hear the future (this is a recurring theme in Greek mythology, though sometimes it brings an ability to understand the language of animals rather than an ability to know the future). However, when she did not return his love, Apollo placed a curse on her so that no one would ever believe her predictions. She is a figure both of the epic tradition and of tragedy, where her combination of deep understanding and powerlessness exemplify the ironic condition of humankind. --- Courtesy Wikipedia See how that fits in with the short story ""Cassandra"" by CJ Cherryh?",cherryhcj,,,,,

A roman soldier or something came by to see his sister a lot, which really pissed him off. I think later he joined some kind of cult or rebellion.

Here's all I can remember: Category: Mystery, Detective, or Romantic Suspense Setting: A country in Africa (I believe -- I'm fairly certain that it was not set in India) Time -- I remember it as being colonial. I think that the police detective was a British inspector assigned there or perhaps had grown up there But I read it in the 1970s/80s. So, no idea if I was reading an older book or a book set in the past. Or perhaps it was post-colonial. I am fairly certain that this was not a book in a series. I liked it and would have read the rest of the series. And although there was a mystery/detective plot involving a murder, it might have been classified as romantic suspense. The female protagonist was a young woman (perhaps a governess, perhaps a traveling companion, or poor relation). She had come to a house (perhaps a plantation or farm) where this murder involving the family and neighbors occurred. I don't remember who the victim was, there may have been more than one. What I do remember is that at the end of the book, the young woman has gone home to England, there is a knock at the door, and it is the inspector (who has fallen in love with her). It was told in third person, may have had multiple viewpoints.  I know this is all a bit vague. I've had various suggestions. As far as I can tell, it isn't a Elspeth Huxley novel.",,,,,,

Firstly, because it was definitely a short story and set nominally on Earth, secondly because it was better written and not at all in ERB's style. Here's a little more detail: Narrator has been tossed into this prison, apparently for participation in a revolt. He keeps hoping for the revolution to come out on top and rescue him. The prisoners have to pull on ropes at certain set times to make the prison rotate. They get food dropped to them from a hole in the ceiling and he uses the food wrappers to create short-lived lights. He is otherwise in darkness. Occasionally, there are cracks or crevices in the outer wall that make it possible for the prisoners to move between cells. He encounters an insane prisoner, but I don't recall if he traveled to the madman's cell or the other way around.

Here's a description I found on my library's site: Set on several islands off the coast of Scotland, primarily around 1000 B.C., this novel's main character is Caitlin, who has the power to live briefly as parallel characters of other times on the islands. She is Catriona, Cathan and Catie, each of whom must chose to act for the good of the islands or not--all choices that revolve around Caitlin's decision whether to reconcile the increasingly hostile islanders with the druids who have recently settled nearby, or to let the two groups fight. As with her earlier novels, Anderson's rather giddy pace through the centuries and her lack of strong characterization is tempered by a marvelous sense of place and by smooth writing",,,,,,

She discovers she is the lost heir to an alternate world, people of special bloodlines can move between the two worlds, ours and a more medieval one. People there live in castles, have a great fear of dimension hopping assassins.

It was a novel about an English schoolboy having some sort of mental breakdown in the late 19th or early 20th Century. He starts to believe that his friend's mother is Eve, and her yard is literally the garden of Eden. It was very much a coming of age story about trying to find one's self in a world that tries to define you. Though she read it in high school, she does not think it was published for young adults. She does not remember when it was published, but is sure it was not new when she read it.  What she does recall very clearly that the title was the name of the main character, and probably started with an 'h'. The cover was an image of the boy in his school uniform.

Maybe my descriptive skills combined with all the brilliant people of the Internet can make this happen. Chapters are broken up into the perspectives/voices of different family members. One son is a carpenter who builds his mother's casket while she is on her death bed. There is a younger boy who thinks his mother is talking to him on the journey because he hears the noises of the corpse decaying inside the casket. There is some old guy who thinks that people aren't supposed to move around because they are built like trees. They are moving the body across the country so she can be laid to rest in some other town. At some point they try to cross a river with their wagon but, alas, just as it is fated while playing 'Oregon Trail' in grade school, the wagon tips over. They dive in the river to find the carpentry tools. I think there's a girl too. She maybe is pregnant and gets/almost gets a sketchy abortion in the town where they end up because she was fooling around with the farm hand. And perhaps there something about borrowing shovels at the end there too that's a quasi-big deal. That or everything the paragraph connected to this sentence is from a different book. I read this book a couple of years ago at the recommendation of a friend who has thus far not responded to my begging for information. I have no idea when it was written, except I assume the author has some interest in post-modern systems of identity as each character is an independent voice (complete with different vocabulary and dialects as necessary). Wait, is post-modern correct there? I know nothing about literature. Thanks for your help!",,,,,,

They told stories in which the reader was cast as protagonist (though there was no 'fighting fantasy' choice element as in ""turn to page 10 to go North, turn to page 11 to go South"""".

Often some sort of problem / cliffhanger would arise and there would be a question about how the character was going to proceed and overcome the problem. When you turned the page you'd find out whether you had guessed the right solution. One I recall as being about a run-down burlesque funfair, and some sort of evil plot involving poison gas hidden in light bulbs (one of the puzzles running through that book involved spotting the bulbs which contained the gas). The other book, in the same series, had a fantasy setting and the only puzzle I remember involved a question of where a character could hide having escaped from a castle into the surrounding moat, the answer being that he should use some reeds to form a snorkel to breathe through.

A young woman gets caught in the blitz in London -- I remember something about a tube station or a bomb shelter. She meets a young man -- a soldier?-- and takes him home -- they have a brief affair and he leaves. Somehow I think she doesn't know his full name and doesn't know how to find him, or maybe he gets wounded and forgets who he is (I may be mixing up two stories here, as I'm also remembering one where the heroine is a nurse and finds the hero amnesiac with a head wound. I don't know if it's the same or not.) Anyway, does this sound familiar to anyone? The heroine's name may be Claire or Mary.",,,,,,

Slim hardcover, can't remember what the dustjacket looked like, but I don't think it was pictorial. A struggling writer moves into a boarding house run by a large-bosomed and rather slovenly landlady. She gives him a typewriter to use, which turns out to be possessed by the previous owner's ghost. The ghost takes over and types out pulp-style adventures in various genres (exploration, detective, sword & sorcery) each involving a mysterious and voluptuous woman, and each missing the ending.  The climax of the book is that the young writer pushes through to the ending of the story and discovers that the Amazon Queen he's questing for is the landlady, with whom the previous lodger was in love.  It may have been written in the early 60s - I read TRIO: The Revolting Intellectuals Organization at about the same time, and it also looked like a new book.

As I write this, I'm watching Simon Schama's ""The Power of Art"" on WGBH. He's devoted an entire show to Van Gogh's ""Wheatfield with Crows."" I was reminded of a short story from one of the ""new horror"" anthologies published about a decade ago. The story is about an art historian who is attempting to understand the breakthrough event during Van Gogh's residency in Arles. The event has an alien/sfnal explanation that results in the narrator going insane in the same manner as as Van Gogh. The title is something like ""Orange is the Color of Paranoia, Blue is the color of Pain.""  Google searches on almost any combination of the words in what I think is the title turn up hits for ""Orange Was the Color of Her Dress Then Silk Blues,"" the jazz classic by Charles Mingus. I'm stuck. Does anyone else know the title and author of the story I'm describing?",,,,,,
