I've googled all sorts of combinations and done everything I can think of to find out what it is, but I've still come up blank. Ok, so it's another one of those post deadly virus survivor films.  I can't even remember who was in it, but I remember it had a pretty brutal ending. After spending the movie trying to figure out how to survive and by the end it looked like death was inevitable, so to be kind the male protagonist shot everyone he had been travelling with in their car.  As he is about to turn the gun on himself, the army come to the scene and it turns out they had an answer to help survive. I just remember thinking it was a cruel thing that the character would have to then live with. Any help on this would be fabulous because I really can't find the movie this engine belongs to! Thanks in advance.",
