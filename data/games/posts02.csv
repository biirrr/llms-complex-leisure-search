Graphics/art style:Pixel art Notable characters: Main character is heavily wrapped in rags and trained in some martial art where he can make as few movements as possible to conserve energy. Notable gameplay mechanics: The big pull was the energy conservation mechanic. Every step you take drains your energy bar and it's best to defeat your enemies in as few movements as possible. Enemies are bound by this mechanic as well allowing players to tire bandits out to defeat them easier. Other details:It was shown off in a gameranx video as a best of some conference list (maybe Gamescom?) Any help would be really appreciated. Thanks a bunch!",3,,,,

There was a German fighter plane that was purple with an iron cross on the side, there was a bi-plane which I remember being part of the British RAF or the American Air Force. *Notable Gameplay Mechanics:* I don't remember the main screen or anything about selecting missions, but I know you got to choose your plane. The best plane for the mission always had ""Recommended"" in yellow text under the photo of the plane. I don't remember the controls but I think the fire button was just left click. It almost reminds me of War Thunder, but I do not think it was not multiplayer and there was no customization of the aircraft. I do not remember what happened if you had died and I don't think there was any type of point system. *Other Details:* If this helps, I remember one of the missions starting off with flying above the coast of some country (probably Germany or France or something, I don't remember if it was a lake, ocean, etc.) with a squadron of other bi-planes. I also remember you had to kill the Red Baron, a red bi-plane (tri-plane?) with 3 sets of wings stacked on top of one another - basically a bi-plane with one more set of wings above. There were AA guns firing and the explosions were going off around your squadron but didn't harm you. I also very vaguely remember a mission where you had to take off of an aircraft carrier.",1,,,,

62,8qimrx,tipofmyjoystick,[NES][before 2000] Action/beat'em up,8qimrx,1,1,6/12/18 14:44,ukaszu,"Platform(s): NES Genre: Action/Beat'em up - single player Estimated year of release: Honestly don't know. I played it before year 2000, but I don't know when it was released. Graphics/art style: Much like DoubleDragon, 2.5D/2D, human character fighting foes (not sure if 100% humans), definitely NOT candys&amp;unicorns style. Notable characters: In boss encounter one protagonist had a sword (a curved one, possibly japanese). One boss was a crane-style master. Other boss had a circular saw blade that he spinned from top of the screen to the bottom, and then back up like a boomerang (that saw you could destroy with a sword-wielding player and the boss, having no weapon, would just attempt to beat you up with it's fists). One boss you fought on a round/oval platform of ice with no edges (so you could jump off and die, you could also manouvre the boss to do the same and win instantly) - that boss ""move"" was to spin on his head on the ice (think break-dance), damaging and pushing you if it hit you, possibly off the platform. Notable gameplay mechanics: You could switch character you were playing (but I don't remember other than the one with the sword), you could transfer hitpoints from ""some female character"" to the one you were playing (using a special menu - and the game played a march-like sound while the hitpoints transferred). Some of the bosses you defeated you could play in other boss encounters (like the crane-style master). Other details: Game was single-player, but the second controller acted like a cheat input (don't remember what could be done, but you entered some key combinations through other controller and it affected the game).",1,unsolved,,,

I remember that some of those scenarios were: \- a bedroom, with some sort of monster under the bed, but you couldn't really see it. You could turn on a tv that was there and watch the news, or listen to music on the radio. \- the front yard, where you could plant flowers and stuff. It had a big tree on the top of the screen and if you clicked on its branches, a squirrel would swing from a rope, making tarzan like sounds. \- the backyard, where you could tend the soil, plant corn and tomatoes and some weird alien vegetables or some creepy things, like, i remember there was a ""baby"" plant, that literally was just baby faces on some sort of fruit plant.

I played it on Windows, most probably XP, sometime from probably-2005-to-2008, downloaded for free. There's a chance it was made earlier than that, maybe made for DOS and was running in an emulator; I have a vague memory that there was some compatibility weirdness. From what I remember of the art style, it was simple with mostly flat colors and shaded edges. (There's a good chance I'm misremembering though.) It had a splitscreen multiplayer focus, and I believe player 1 and 2 were red and yellow ships, with a simple ""Asteroids"" design. Some of the levels included bumpers on the walls that would push your ship back. One level covered the walls with them. I think one level was mostly full of water, but it was just a colored background and didn't affect physics. I got the impression it was designed to be easy to add custom levels.

85,8sodzb,tipofmyjoystick,[PC] Life simulation game in which you're born as a random person in the world,8sodzb,1,16,6/21/18 4:53,KadevKade,"I played this game about 5-8 years ago. It was a PC game, I think it was played online on a website but I can't remember for sure, it may have been a download. From what I can remember, on the start you were born as a random human. You could be male or female, be born with a genetic defect, or whatever. If you were born female in a country like Saudi Arabia, it would give you a message saying that you can't vote or work and have few rights. If the country was low in development, you were likely to die as a baby from sickness or starve to death, and it was more difficult to make a good life. You were more likely to be born in populous countries like China, and very unlikely to be born in low population countries. After that you made different decisions on how you wanted to live your life. Your character had different stats like intelligence which determined how successful they could be, like if you could go to a university and become a doctor. You had relationship stats with your family members, and I think there was even a basic romance system where you could have a partner, get married, and have kids. I remember you could be arrested and killed for political activism. The interface mostly consisted of looking at a map of the world and reading pop ups about news and your life, and I think there was a separate interface screen to look at your stats and view things like your family members. The graphics of the game were extremely basic, mostly consisting of numbers and a map, and I think maybe some very basic ugly models for characters.",3,,,,

This is what i also remember : - It's a platformer, jump and shoot, there is a boss at the end of a set of levels. - The settings of the game is at some urban city area, with hiphop music most of the time. - The character is actually a graffiti drawings, he is always sticked on a wall. He jumps and shoots other monster also made from graffiti drawings. I can't say if it's 2d or 3D platformer, because all of the time the character is sticked to the wall but sometimes camera changes as player jumps from one wall to another.

You were able to advance one screen to the left, the right or upwards and often you had the choice between multiple of those. Often you had to fight enemies that were placed in front of your character. **Notable characters:** Don't remember. **Notable gameplay mechanics:** I know it had a password save system.

When you wanted to continue your game, you had the option to load one of those states. **Other details:** I played it in my childhood in Germany.

If your score goes down substantially though the mermaid will go away **Notable gameplay mechanics:** So like there's different fish feed you can feed your fish, and different kinds of feed have different effects on the fish. I can't remember any specific effects though, but you gotta like, sprinkle the feed in front of the fish so it sees the feed and goes for it. **Other details:** Most of the fish in the game are tropical fish, I think.

The worlds were mostly bright colored. I remember a level on a pirate ship, you would jump across the ship defeating pirates. There is also a level where you have to climb up a giant green bean stalk. Notable characters: I distincly remember the story went like this. A human boy woke up at night to an elf like boy with (I think) green hair to help save his fantasy world. They sort of fuse and I thought one of the characters name was Coco. Notable gameplay mechanics: as the fusion boy who saves the world you had to defeat enemies. I remember this could be done by shooting fireballs out of your hands. You could also do a kick on the ground. When jumping and kicking you could infinitly jump around doing roundhouse kicks. If you would also press the command to shoot fireballs, it would causd you to jump while roundhousing while also shooting fireballs. Other details: In the pirate ship level there was a girl in the background you could somehow interact with and receive a kiss from. I'm not sure but I think the Icon of the game on my desktop looked like a pineapple. There was a way using cheat codes to unlock al the different levels. Iirc there were around 5 or 7.

When I was in grade school, we had a game day in class. One of my friends brought their Gameboy Advance or possibly Gameboy Color. My memory is pretty hazy, but I'll give it my best go. **Platform(s):** Gameboy Advance or Gameboy Color **Genre:** Adventure **Estimated year of release:** Played it between 2001 or 2003, not sure of exact release. Probably was released around this time. **Graphics/art style:** Similar to Pokemon, but def not Pokemon. Top-down camera, similar art style. The part of the game we played was set in a village with wooden buildings and paths, in a wooded area. Dialogue between characters may have also been similar to Pokemon, but my memories could be bleeding together a bit. **Notable characters:** I believe we played as the protagonist who was a boy with brown hair, I think there was a wolf involved somehow as an enemy **Notable gameplay mechanics:** The town we were in was open to be explored, I think we engaged with some wild animals in turn-based battle. **Other details:** Spirits may have been involved in the storyline or maybe some wild animals were uncharacteristically attacking the town. Something was going on, and the protagonist had to figure out the situation in classic adventure style. Thanks for the time!",1,,,,

My details on this one are blurry. As a kid I remember watching my dad play a lot of games on his PC but one always sticks out because it always interested me. What I remember is that it was a first person shooter. I don't remember what enemies there were except one - a giant mech. I don't remember how big it was exactly but I remember that it was very slow. It took its steps very slowly as it tried to go after you. One detail that I feel very certain and yet also cautious of was how it was beaten. There were green computers and when you used them the mech was stopped. It either shut down or blew up, I can't remember, but this is the detail that sticks in my mind the most because I specifically remember being in the playground with my friends and essentially role-playing this game and I definitely made them go to a green computer to defeat a giant robot. I don't know how much of that is accurate but it sticks out in my mind. There are a few other details floating around. I think one of the green computers was on top of something you had to climb up (maybe a stack of barrels or crates) and the mech was chasing you through a corridor out into a small, open area outside where the computer was. And this may have been from a different game but I think I remember a lizard-y alien thing in some sort of water area. As for the time, I must have between 2 and 6 years old when I saw it. That would have put it anywhere between 1999 and 2003. I don't remember the graphics, I am inclined to say 64 bit but I don't know.

It was a cartoon style. There were three characters and each one represented each different problem. My memory is hazy, but I think I recall the drug guy being tall and maybe red (I remember that if you win, he quits drugs and becomes a pole vaulter), the gang guy was big, blue and violent and the thief was a green woman. I remember that in order to win, you had to collect pieces of each of the character's mind and put it together for them so they could come to their senses and quit breaking the law and being a bad citizen. I never had time to get the minds of the gang guy and shoplifter. I only remember one specific scene in the game, it was with the drug user and he was showing the kids in the game how to sniff airplane glue out of a paper bag. The whole game barely pulled punches with showing the guy strung out and jonesing. That's all I can remember, the gameplay was mainly watching scenes of bad stuff, and why it's bad and shouldn't do it. I remember one mini game where it teaches you about gang colors, and you shouldn't wear gang colors, and it consisted of a choosing a color not related to a gang.",1,,,,

Gameplay was 3d. **Notable characters:** Main character was a male with a monster arm. And it might've grown to more of his body as the game progressed, at least on his status bar **Notable gameplay mechanics:** It was probably top down Point-of-View. Enemies were lizard monsters varying in size and there was a mechanic to actually have them follow you. They moved on four legs. Your monster arm was shown at the top-right(maybe) and as you got stronger it covered more of your body. ALSO, just remembered, I think there was a representation of your Energy/Stamina in the form of (red?)spheres (over your head?) You gained more over time and enemies probably had it as well. **Other details:** The name of the game was likely a single word. I thought it was ""Monster"" for sure, and the fact that I can't find it anywhere is weird. I played this game definitely after 2005, and definitely before 2015.

The whole concept was something along the lines of having to connect to a server/computer and virtually enter it, repairing broken pieces of it as mentionned in mechanics in order to fix the corruption/glitches. The last time I saw it, it was in heavy development and no longer downloadable (this was something around the year I've mentionned). The intro of the game was a puzzle in itself, requiring the player to figure out various commands to prepare a connection to the virtual world via a command terminal.

The classes were basically a rectangle body with a circle head on top and a weapon to the side, and the shapes had a few extra detailed lines that made it easy to distinguish classes. **Notable characters:** You could pick a variety of classes. The one's I remember were 1\) The heavy, which had a minigun 2\) What I call the guardian, which had a shield that stopped bullets. 3\) The lancer which had a rod and did bonus damage to heavy and guardian, 4\) Medic, which healed and had a shotgun 5\) A basic soldier class with an AR and grenades 6\) The fucking assasin which could one\-shot #3\-5 with a melee and is invisible until he's near an enemy.

The maps follow a similar pattern, being block based for distance and levels for platforms. Notable characters: I remember there being at least 5 factions, each with a handful of characters each. There was a Catholic/noble knight faction you start working with for the first mission, with a robed old man as the Leader. There was an Underworld geoup, with a bare chested animalistic man and a big chested woman as it's leaders. There was an eastern empire with multiple young girls as its generals. There was a Elven nation, which if I remember correctly had a mage with a floppy bunny ear hat with a crucifix shaped staff. There was also an evil empire, with a vampire looking dude that looked like a castlevania rip off. For the main party I remember there being two male heroes, a blond and a brunette both in standard boring armor. There was also a female sidekick healer. The only Unique character I remember that wasn't from a conquered nation was a tan girl raised by goblins, with a studded club as a weapons and the verbal tick ""Gobli Gobli"". I didn't beat the game, but it seemed like the main villain was a giant flaming demon monster that was possessing a child. I remember the reveal mission had them find Tue child in a burning village, and he started crying until he exploded into a demon form that was invincible. Notable gameplay mechanics: There was a big focus on having a normal sized party against many enemy units. Most of the non main mission quests were set types of jobs to help one nation attack another nation. Like ""cut off supplies"" or ""capture enemy general"". On the fields there were glowing runes that had different effects, and were the main way to gain the advantage in a fight. I also remember you could explode the runes to cause other runes to change effects in some way. Beyond that it honestly played mostly like a squaresoft tactical dog with equip item slots and generic skills and magic. Other details: mainly I remember that the game was a sequel, either 2 or 3 in the series. I also remember the board was a brownish red background with the main heroes overlapping into a L shape, like how a lot of dog titles used to show character faces. It had a really artsy but forgettable name, like resonance of fate or infinite undiscovery. But my memory is vague so that may be wrong",1,,,,

It is an ARPG, first person. the first part when you start is outside roam around a bit then find some goblins that lead to a door, you cannot get through it, so you have to go into this sewer system with slimes and chests you can lock pick which eventually leads to some scaffolding above the water to get by. You fight through more goblins till you get to I think a cave troll in what looks like an opera room or something, you kill it and it then leads to a decently expansive town with another cave troll caught in a cage and several quests about a card system I think from a Goblin. After roaming around the city you are suppose to go into a crypt and kill a ghost or you are attacked by ghost summons and even in the city you start getting attacked by assassins or some weird summons after awhile, which then eventually the cave troll breaks free and you have to kill it then it leads you out into a wilderness area. I know most of this is extremely vague, but this is all I can really remember, but I want to play this again pretty bad because I remember it being really fun, very oblivion esque, but I think it came out before it.",4,,,,

After you've defeated him there was a cutscene where he sits on the floor with his back against the wall and you talk to him. **Notable gameplay mechanics:** You could shoot enemies but also melee fight them and I CLEARLY remember them dropping green stacks of cash like in GTA when killed and they would also drop their weapons. You could walk around the city streets but I'm not sure if it was open world or just a level. I didn't drive any vehicles of any sort. Aside from the club mentioned earlier I remember a part were two guys in black suits get out of an elevator and you fight them. **Other details:** The memories I have of this game are very vague so I can't say everything I wrote is 100&amp;#37; accurate.

I've only now found out that the Game that I so fondly remembered playing when I was a kid seems to not have been Bio Menace, but seemingly a rather elaborate bootleg version of it. It's basically the same assets, with a few differences Notable Differences to Bio Menace are -No Red Diamonds that you can pick up, no actual keys either to my knowledge -The Game itself lacked background music and was a lot more serious in tone, you'd see a woman get eaten by a monster as you progress forward in the beginning -The Enemies themselves all had a different, less cartoony look to them -Apparently the Original was an Episodic Game, which was not the case in the version that I played -A lot of visual changes, the Sewer Water in a sewer for example was green in the version that I played, not blue -And the Levels themselves, while thematically the same overall, had a completely different layout It's probably a long shot to expect you guys to identify something as vague as that, but who knows.

The next level you had a grand dining room kinda, and windows would break and paintings fly off the walls to try and hit your character and you had to click on them to help her.

I remeber the character was dressed in black and there was some kind of balaclava covering his face. Maybe a burglar of some sort. If my old memory isn't THIS faulty, I think there was a portrait of the character with almost just his eyes displaying because of said balaclava.

691,8obsrq,tipofmyjoystick,[PC] [1998] Unknown mod for Quake II,8obsrq,1,11,6/3/18 23:19,Quake2Reefer,"Platform: PC Genre: mod for Quake II Estimated year of release: 1998 Graphics / art style: Sponsored textures and the logos of ID Software and Activision would seem to indicate an official release of some sort, maybe on an expansion disc. The map pictured appears similar to / a Q2 conversion of the Levelord map hipdm1 ""The Edge of Oblivion"" for the original Quake. Notable characters: Appears to be 2v2 or 1v1, red team and blue team. Notable gameplay mechanics: Appears from the youtube video evidence to be a mod of single flag capture. The single flag respawns on the lower level of the map. The two teams battle to grab it and bring it up to their platform.

I think the id and Activision logos are maybe unauthorised and just there to give the Quake TV pitch legitimacy, for DukeMedia to say to any potential networks/buyers ""This is how Quake TV could look"". I presume one of the potential companies they pitched the idea of a ""Quake TV"" show to was FX Sports, seeing as their channel logo also appears in your screenshots, but, again, I imagine this was DukeMedia using the logo simply as ""proof of concept"" material, with no actual permission sought from FX Sports.",2,,,,

But just because that's what it sounds like, removed from 20 years, who knows what really happened. However I do not think that in 1998 (with Quake II being released in Dec 1997), DukeMedia would risk not getting licenses for these textures.

Those guys never even had a website or Planetquake page for their project, it was so short lived. There actually WAS a mod for Quake II called Quake TV that came out in late 1999 / 2000 and was a semi-total conversion of Smash TV for Q2. Subsequently, other projects have been called Quake TV. Whatever these guys had going in 1998, based on my research, its unlikely they ever had official rights to use the name, ""Quake TV.""",1,,,,

More theorizing- I think its more likely that this map / mod existed, and was separate from, Quake TV (which AFAIK after a year of research had no staff, no coders, no mappers, no skinner, other than Peter Duke who called himself DukeMedia). In that scenario, Peter Duke could have created an unauthorized custom texture set and made a demo on SOMEBODY ELSE'S mod / map and then solicited recams, in order to pitch his Quake TV idea to the companies whose logos he featured. That's definitely possible would love to get to the bottom of this whole thing. Please internet universe.",1,,,,

I think the map might be throwing you off the scent and was possibly a pre-existing map that DukeMedia sent to The Immortal along with their hokey ""Quake TV"" mod and unauthorised logo assets etc that they'd made, which never saw the light of day with a public release. All specualtion on my part, obviously, but, as you rightly allude to, every single Quake mod was listed, archived and categorised even back then, on Planetquake, in forums etc. I think DukeMedia were naive chancers who got The Immortal to put them together a machinima demo/recam that they were hoping to use to sell some sports network on the idea of ""Quake TV"". They may well have realised somewhere along the line that, seeing as they didn't have any rights to Quake, the idea was absolutely ridiculous and a huge waste of time, and quietly disappeared themselves from The Immortal and the rest of the scene to save embarrassment over their dumb idea?! As I say, just guesses really, but might give you some potential angles to explore. I'm standing by my theory that the mod itself (at least with those id/FX Sports/G Shock/Activision logo textures) never saw a public release though, and will be keeping an eye on your further detective work into this mystery!",2,,,,

DukeMedia seems to have been just one individual, Peter Duke, based out of SoCal and worked at Sega opening their new Gameworks arcades (MTV was a partner, and their logo was in the mystery mod) in Seattle, Las Vegas, etc. Sounds like his specialty was in the back end, networking the machines. Here's a made-up scenario: ""After opening Sega's first American mega-arcades, called GameWorks, Peter Duke wants to branch out on his own building on his specialized knowledge in coding for computer games competitions. Duke starts ""Quake TV"", and plans to pitch his idea to GameWorks partners like MTV, Mountain Dew and Skittles."" In Quake TV, competitors do battle in real time at a real world arena, like Gameworks, while thousands spectate inside the virtual arena with them."" That would be an amazing story!

I remember playing an old side-scrolling game when I was a kid in which you play as three or four different people in a ‚Äúparty‚Äù or whatever you want to call it, one of the characters was a mole person or something with goggles and I think a robot hand or something (sounds nuts I know XD) maybe not a mole person, maybe just short and fat...well either way, short and fat. Lol I don‚Äôt remember anything else about him other than him wearing a brown shirt or coat or something. If I remember correctly, his special ability was that he can dig through certain parts of the area, a tomb or something if I remember correctly. One of the other characters was a bigger guy, buff I think, naturally he was the powerhouse that could move heavy things. Another was a shorter character, maybe a kid or something, skinny if I remember right. I don‚Äôt remember the other character, but for some reason I keep thinking of Disney when I try to remember. Pretty sure i played it on the gameboy advance, but for some reason it also makes me think of the ps2, but I‚Äôm pretty sure it was a handheld game. I think it resembled the hell out of the secret side scrolling level in prince of Persia sands of time, same or similar 3d design and whatnot, same idea.

I was no older than 5 when this was out so the details are INCREDIBLY hazy but I will try to answer any other questions people might have.",1,,,,

You were apparently locked inside and trying to escape. I think the toys were coming to life. **Platform(s):** PC, possibly a DOS game but I don't think it was **Genre:** Horror, fixed perspective third person. **Estimated year of release:** 1993? **Graphics/art style:** Polygonal characters set against still backgrounds. Camera was fixed; you could move around in a scene, and scene would change if you moved into a different area, a la the classic *King's Quest* games **Notable characters:** Main character resembled a garden gnome? Was either a woman or a child, possibly both. It also featured a Jack-in-the-box very early in the game that I think was sentient, maybe the villain **Notable gameplay mechanics:** Honestly can't remember much of anything about the gameplay other than the character being difficult to control because of the camera perspective. I believe it had an inventory system like old point and click adventure games (I don't think this game was P&amp;C to control though) I'm not sure if this was a demo or something because I don't think it was a very big game.",1,,,,

We've been scouring google for the last two hours. I've been pulling my hair out over it, maybe it was some secret military developed simulator (we're both military, yet it supposedly had 240+ player servers). As such, I've been interrogating him for every possible detail. **Platform(s):** PS3 (May have been exclusive) **Genre:** First Person Shooter, Squad Based **Estimated year of release:** 2010-2013 **Graphics/art style:** 3D, near AAA- level graphics. Gloomy/Darker Colors, Environments always included buildings of some type in environments like a desert or a city. (Even skyscrapers/very tall buildings were fully explorable and destructible). **Notable characters:** None - Strictly multiplayer w/ generic class set (Medic, gunner, rifleman, sniper) **Notable gameplay mechanics:** Fully destructible environments (Red Faction: Guerrilla level of detail), but not necessarily terrain destructible. Had land and air vehicles (like fighters and even \*bombers\*), but not necessarily sea. Unlimited respawning. At least partial gun customization mid game (like changing your sights at base between iron sights and reflex) **Other details:** Game was king-of-the-hill objective based, or CTF based. \~240 player servers (in 2010-2013, mind you, and estimated 5-15 servers at time of playing). Rounds easily passed 30+ minutes. Map scale was below ArmA III level (miles and miles), but just about Battlefield level (such a size to enable the use of vehicles). Game was distributed on a PS3 disc. Games had stationary emplacements like turrets and full artillery cannons. Vehicles had state-based destruction (like most games - normal, smoking, then destroyed). Player health was value based (just a 0-100 value, non-regenerating, must be healed by medic type). Destructibility varied by material (wood was easier, but didn't splinter like in Rainbow 6 Siege, concrete could take more damage, glass existed as well). Bullet penetration was a thing. You could not build in this game. Friendly fire was enabled. 4-5 players per squad, roughly 20 squads on each team. Very little or no advertising done for the title during it's time.

I'm trying to remember the title of a game that's relatively recent (after 2012 I believe) that is a kind of a horror survival shooter within a weird game show or that partially involved the player being part of a game show..

You'd start it from command-line, which _may_ have accepted some options, such as number of bugs on-screen, and the game would play itself until a key was pressed, after which it would give the score obtained (number of bugs zapped) and exit. **Other details:** This thing was hardly a game. When the program started, it would display a static graphic background, which appeared to be a nighttime scene in an empty park, with a single active lamp (something like [this](https://www.featurepics.com/StockImage/20070730/lamp-post-in-the-park-stock-picture-395738.jpg)) Flying insects, composed of just a few pixels each, would appear at the edges of the screen and fly a slow, pseudorandom path to the light, where they would get ""zapped"" with a sound (via PC internal speaker). There were no controls except the ""quit"" key. The program didn't accept any user input and there was no way to affect anything in the game once it started. (As far as I know.) When the game exited, it would display a message: ""You zapped X nasty bugs!"" with X being the number of bugs killed. It was almost a screensaver, except that it wouldn't have actually done a good job at saving screens since the main background was static and would burn-in if left running. It's possible this was something hobby-coded by some anonymous author, in which case it may be impossible to find again. I played it at my uncle's house in the Toronto area in Canada around '93. (I was an easily-amused kid.) I have no idea where he got it - he used to have a big pile of floppy disks with all kinds of random programs on them. Years later, I asked him about some of them and he doesn't remember most. I've been able to track down almost all the ones I remember, but this one is super-obscure.",1,,,,

SAME CHARACTER THROUGHOUT, SAME TIMELINE, SAME UNIVERSE. I believe they all have the same title just with either a [2] or [3] for the succeeding installments.) -Computer / PC game -Horror, point-and-click interactions (lots of jumpscares, scary af) - 3 part series (first game was in her house, second in a hospital, third on a train) - Main character was a young girl (either Asian or white or something, she was pale idk) - Probably made in the early 2000s (I played it in elementary school which was about ~2010 times) - No dialogue This game scared the living hell out of me and my friends when I was younger, back in about 2009 / 2010. It was a series of 3 separate games, which I'll try to describe below. Game One: The House - Wake up in bedroom - Mom and Dad not home at some late hour of the night for some reason - Dead quiet - Freaky scary shit happens in the bathroom - Handprintjumpscare.gif - I think there was some spacebar mashing in order to not get killed - You locked some trunk in your room for some reason or another so you had to go get the key - Also have some VHS or something - Put VHS in VHS player in parent's room - Same creepy bitch from the bathroom comes walkin in - Hide under the bed so you don't get murdered by creepy bitch - More spacebar mashing - Blah Blah Blah eventually get the key - Open the trunk - Get flashlight - The game ends with you (the girl character) walking down the stairs in complete darkness with your flashlight Game Two: The Hospital - Wake up on hospital bed - Ohfuck.jpg - Bloody tools all around you on the tables - GTFO the operation room - Walk around turning on lights and shit - Place is absolutely abandoned except for one thing ... - Creepy bitch is back - Hide behind hospital curtains to avoid being slaughtered - More spacebar mashing if she pulls the curtains back - The door to the basement / exit is locked - Do some fancy convoluted shit to get the key - Creepy bitch is still wanderin the halls at the speed of a turtle - Eventually get out (I never actually finished the game but I had looked up a how-to guide on it when I had played it several years ago, some shit about using soda machines and plants and shit ?!) Game Three: The Train - Wake up on a train - Place is fucking empty again - The seats are all orange - The train is moving but you don't remember where you're going - Train goes into tunnel and outside goes dark I never finished the last two games (the third one I gave up on because I got stuck like a minute in and didn't have the intelligence to look up a walk-through) but I hope that's enough information. I'd love to know if anyone else every played one, two or all three of these games and could tell me what they were called ! Maybe now that I'm older they won't scare me as much.

There were other characters around the island they would visit, including a king and queen who lived in a sand castle. Notable gameplay mechanics: As the player you chose where on the island the children visited, and they were taken there by their train friend. I believe it was mostly point-and-click and exploratory, I don‚Äôt remember there being much in the way of gameplay. Other details: the most vivid memory I have of the game was the sand castle location, I believe the characters (a king and a queen) said that their home got washed away every day by the surf but they always rebuilt it. There was a stage that had more involved gameplay where the train went underwater and you navigated a sort of maze to recover pearls from mermaids, or with the help of mermaids?

1392,8r1p1m,tipofmyjoystick,Looking for an old game similar to dig-dug,8r1p1m,1,7,6/14/18 15:06,HammerBros235,"2D game that looks, and also you move and dig sands just like dig\-dug. But game play is different. It's a game you dig around, kill spider and red round face enemy with a red orb, or a green spongy tile. Don't know how to beat the level, but you open a gate from a level, and go back and enter. It has multiple stages. * Controls: Up, right, left, right. * Gameplay : Main character is a blond male. You start from top\-left. The sand is yellow, and background color that appears after you dig is black. There are 2 types of enemies. One is a grey spider that moves along the wall, and the other is a round red face that moves in a straight line cardinally. You touch the enemy (when the enemy is right adjacent to you), you die. You kill them by pushing a red orb bombs just like a boulder from dig\-dug. There's also a tile that kills enemy when it touches. It's a green spongy tile with 2 holes. It disappears after enemy dies. The exit is a stone arched gate. Forgot how to open it though. It's a fixed tile. * Graphic/sprite: It is also similar to dig\-dug. All the enemy,player sprites face the screen(you). So spider's sprite is as if you looked at it from above, 4 legs at each side. Not sure but it has 2 eyes. Red round face enemy is just a red circle with 2 pixels of eyes (just like a pig's from minecraft), a nose, and a mouth that it constantly opens and closes. * Levels: There are some distinct things I remember from levels. First level: You start from Top\-left, it is a small room with a spider, 2 exits. Outside, top\-right, there are lots of red bombs. At the bottom, there are lots of spiders in a single dug\-out line, strange for them to be so many as it being the first level. I remember not having to touch it. \-\-\-\-\- It was from a collection that also had bubble\-bobble, dig\-dug. But the collection itself won't help. I've done researches for days, but I couldn't find any. Really appreciated if you know what game I'm having a problem with! Not: Supaplex, Boulder Dash, Digger T. Rock, Quarries of Scred, Digging Jim, etc.",1,,,,

Black ""nothing"" as a background, the rest is represented by text and simple geometric shapes, which were outlined in color, but otherwise black. Similar to the 1st Oregon Trail game, but even uglier. **Notable characters:** You played a poor African farmer, but there are no characters to be seen. **Notable gameplay mechanics:** A farming simulation - you select an area, choose what to do there. Since the farmland was located on a slope, you needed to build terraces before growing anything. I remember millet being a possible crop. The game was turn-based, with one action per field and month. Or per season, not sure. I never managed to beat the game or get even close to it, you are close to bankruptcy/starvation right from the start, and random natural disasters, droughts and such make it even harder. **Other details:** I played the game on the school's library computer (the only accessible computer we had at the time). There was a rumour that the game was intentionally designed to be unbeatable to raise awareness of famines in africa. I _thought_ the title was ""hunger in africa"", but I can't find anything of the sort. I came across a game ""food force"" when googling, but that one is far too new and pretty.",1,,,,

Not cartooney. You start in a small village, there is a desert level, jungle level, and facility level. Jungle has quicksand and electric barriers, and facility has white tiled floor. **Notable Characters:** your character (you could look really funky with body parts from several different races), final boss with super overpowered body parts, green tall intelligent race (only race I remember), enemies with cones of vision **Notable Gameplay Mechanics:** You challenge NPC's and trade your arms, legs, torso, and (maybe) head with NPC's with the goal of improving your stats (if you lose they take a part they want, unlimited chances to challenge certain NPC's). Enemies with cones of vision chase you down until you get away or get caught (there's frantic music and their cone flashes red, and the whole screen might flash red as well). Minigame where you toss balls into a goal vs NPC. Minigame where you interact with pterodactyl looking things. Item that you pick up, and then throw to stun opponent for 10s or so. **Other:** I think ""Quest"" is part of the game title. Character makes a distinctive ""HUH"" when he jumps, and you can air strafe a ton. I think there are areas with low-vision where there's fog of war everywhere except where your enemies' and your cones light up. I'm 20 and must have played this when 6 or 7. After beating the final boss, you take his overpowered body, go back to the starting village, and can basically jump to the moon.",2,unsolved,,,
