8nnqop	game	extra	reddit	Mutant Game. Trying to remember a game I believe on the Xbox 360. You are some sort of cop in a town with a mutant outbreak happening, and you slowly become more and more powerful as the game progresses. I believe there are missions where you find like a hole in the ground and mutants are pouring out that you need to close. I also think I remember a cutscene with a reporter talking about the outbreak and then being killed by a mutant. Thanks for the help. Jumping between rooftops was definitely a part of the gameplay.
8nows7	game	extra	reddit	Similar to Joe and Mac [snes]. With the release of Joe and Mac on Switch I thought it was the game I was looking for but I remember playing it as a kid and thought it had an overworld similar in style to Mario 3. I remember the level icons illuminating red and once you beat them they turn blue but don’t see an overworld in this game. I looked up joe and Mac 2 and it’s definitely not that one. Can anyone help a brother out? Edit: Here is a link to James and Mike Mondays playing the version I have played when I was a kid. Did the content get cut for the switch version? https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TUd03A9OIug&amp;app=desktop

Played the game in 3rd or 4th grade (2012 - 2013) **
8nq6my	game	extra	reddit	School Classroom design game from early 2000s. **Platform\(s\):** PC; it was an in\-browser game **Genre:** Casual, Design **Estimated year of release:** Early to mid\-2000s \(I didn't get the Internet until circa 2005\) **Graphics/art style:** Simulation style, featuring angled gameplay \(not quite top\-down, but not side facing either\). Semi\-realistic. **Notable characters:** No characters, as it was a design game **Notable gameplay mechanics:** You could add tables and computers, as well as rotate some items and place walls. **Other details:** The purpose of the game was to design a classroom in a school \- there were several objects like desks and plants, walls, computers etc. It was a PC browser game like those hosted on The Popular Flash Websites.

8nqg9k	game	extra	reddit	[Possibly mac?][Late 80s-Early 90s]Adventure game about saving your girlfriend from a spider?. **Platform(s):** Computer of some sort, possibly mac. **Genre:** Point and Click Adventure - same genre as Kings Quest. **Estimated year of release:** Likely late 80's early 90's. **Graphics/art style:** Fairly high resolution possibly around 640x480, mostly white with black line art. Closest image I could find is this: https://i.ytimg.com/vi/KCkbp4wurW0/hqdefault.jpg There wasn't any shading that I remember, mostly just lines. **Notable characters:** I think one of the first things you encounter is the protagonist (a male) and a spider web in a forested area. If you walk into the spider web, a giant spider descends on you and it's game over. I think you might see your girlfriend being snatched by some monster and the goal is to save her. **Notable gameplay mechanics:** You could freely move around backwards, forwards, left and right. You can see the protagonist (it isn't first person, your character has a sprite). I don't think there was any jumping. I think when you walked to the edge of the screen, another background would load and you'd appear on the opposite side. **Other details:** I think the only sound effects, if any, were from a simple PC speaker. I'll add further details as they come to mind.
8nqgal	game	extra	reddit	[PS3] Driving/Zombie game, possibly a demo. Quite a few years ago, probably late 00's or maybe early 10's, I played a game on my brothers PS3. I don't remember much from it, just that it was 3D driving game where you drove around and ran over zombies. You could also change the appearance of your car, and add different bumpers and such. I also think my brother said it was a demo game he had never played, but I might be misremembering. The only other thing I remember was that a rock song from the soundtrack had the lyrics ""Please don't talk about me when I'm gone"". I know Willie Nelson has a song with that name, but I'm pretty sure it's not that. Edit: I guess I also should specify that what I played was single\-player. There might have been multi\-player or local co\-op, but if so I'm not aware of it. I think the game also had some sort of mission system, but I never touched it.
8nqpt8	game	extra	reddit	[Android][2012-2017] Looking for a mobile RPG that seems like it was made in RPG maker. **Platform(s):** Android **Genre:** RPG **Estimated year of release:** 2012-2017 **Graphics/art style:** Pixelated, similar to RPG Maker (probably made by RPG maker) **Notable characters:** The main protagonist are 4 kids trying to play a DND session, I can't remember what the rest chose but i rememeber a guy choosing a ninja class saying speed is important and this one guy says, ""It's all about Grit and chooses the Pirate class"" And then Ninja says he can't choose that because he's already an assassin or something. but and found a book at the basement(now i can't remember). But it plays to a cutscene where two guards talk about last night's party, (guard 1 says he got laid), and the villain tries to summon (spaghetti cthulu i guess) using a virgin female's blood but failed because the girl whose blood is being used got ""Drunk in the party and a thing happened"". **Notable gameplay mechanics:** It's pretty much like an RPG maker game (turn based combat) And then you can position your players for eficiency like Darkest Dungeon.
8nqsym	game	extra	reddit	[PC][2005–2009] 4x4 driving game. **Platform\(s\):** PC **Genre:** 4x4 driving/racing, was not a hardcore simulation **Estimated year of release:** Between 2005 and 2009 **Graphics/art style:** Realistic, not too colorful, looked quite good quality at the time **Notable gameplay mechanics:** The camera was behind the car like in most racing games, but it zoomed out pretty far, almost to a top\-down view, and possibly was mouse\-controllable. There were traffic cars on the roads. **Other details:** The beginning of the game had you driving your SUV to a hotel/motel somewhere in the hills. There were tall trees in the surrounding environment and traffic cars on the roads. It was late and possibly raining. There was no time limit \(or it didn't matter — point is, you were not in a rush\). The hotel/motel was supposed to be where you live while acting out the events of the game \(or the first part of it\), but really it was a ""get from point A to point B and learn the controls"" kind of thing. Ī can't recall what happened later in the game. I think the ""4x4"" thing is important.
8nrt8a	game	extra	reddit	[DOS] [early 90s] turn based military strategy. I played this with a friend back in university, in late 1994. There was a procedurally generated map, and you could have multiple players, either people via hotseat, or computer controlled. You would start with a number of vessels, air, land and sea, including a mobile command center. You had to locate and destroy the other players. You would choose your moves.. attack, move, send a plane to scout this area, etc... then hit done, or next, and then the others would choose their moves, etc. Airplane moves would happen immediately, but other vehicles would only move when it became your turn again, they'd do their thing, then you would choose their next. It was almost like a turn based command and conquer, but without the base building.
8nsjug	game	extra	reddit	[PSX][early 2000s?] Japanese slice of life game. **Platform(s):** PSX **Genre:** Life simulator, probably? It has a slice of life feel, but I dunno if it's a life sim (like Harvest Moon) or if it's more of an adventure game (like Chu-Lip). **Graphics/art style:** IIRC, 3D, with simple models and soft colors. There is a lot of green in the scenarios I remember. **Other details:** Japanese series, never released in the West, and not known in the West either, so probably never got a fanmade translation patch. Multiple games released for PSX, maybe for other platforms too, but I'm only sure about PSX. You control a boy living in a traditional Japanese small city. Sorry for the lack of more details, this game has been in my mind these days and for the life of me I can't remember its name x_x

8ntnzb	game	extra	reddit	[TOMT][VIDEO GAME] Celtic RPG that was pre-installed on my Gateway laptop. When I was a kid, circa 2006-8, my dad bought a Gateway laptop which for some reason had pre-installed games (mostly demos). One of those games was a medieval/celtic based rpg with (I think) 3D graphics. The camera was a 3rd person fixed with a view from above. You played as a kid/teenage boy or girl and for some reason I remember them being relatively short and you could add warpaint. As any RPG, you had quests and sometimes you would end up in dungeons, I remember collecting a lot of gems for some reason. For some reason I remember that the game had a short name, 4 to 5 letters. I also remember it had celtic music. I don't have that much information, as I was a child when I played that game, but in case any of you know what it is, it would make the child in me happy!

8nuib2	game	extra	reddit	Please help old ps2 game. Sorry in advance for the terrible description but it was so long ago that I played it I’ve forgotten most of the detail. Platform: PS2 Genre:Action RPG possibly a JRPG Estimate year of release: 2000s sorry have no idea on this one Graphics/art style: it was in 3D and was quite good for its time, I think Notable characters: you controlled a small team and they were the only humans for most of the game Notable game play mechanics: pretty ordinary turned based combat with loot and stuff. Other detail: the game started out at a port where you gang gets a ship they set sail and crash on an island, you fight monsters and work your way through the island, with different areas etc. Also I think it was part of a series off games as it started of as if the player knew the characters, but I might be wrong. I know this sounds like the most generic description of an RPG but any help would be much appreciated. Thank you for any suggestions and help.
8nv5bk	game	extra	reddit	[NES] third person jumping game. NES (pretty sure) I used to own this game as a kid and played it all the time yet I can’t remember the name or find anything about it. It was a third person perspective where the ground was a checker board like pattern and you had to jump like crazy over gaps, around things, from tiny spring to tiny spring. Each level ended with a centipede like end boss that had to be destroyed section by section. I rember it being crazy hard and I don’t think I ever beat it.
8nv5is	game	extra	reddit	Game from E3 a few years ago. I don't remember much about it, and I've looked through every ""best of E3"" list on IGN going all the way back to 2012. When I couldn't find it there, I looked through every game featured at E3 through those years on IGN, but with so many to look through, it's possible I missed it in that search. What I *do* remember is that the graphics were realistic, and the game looked open-world to some degree, much like games such as Horizon: Zero Dawn or Dragon Age: Inquisition. There was a point in the gameplay trailer where the controlled character turned into a bird to fly to an island to follow a waypoint. The character was wearing primitive tribal type clothing. I feel like turning into animals was a core part of the mechanics and story of the game. This has been driving me crazy for a while now, because I swear I remember this game, but I haven't heard anything about it since that trailer as far as I know, and I can't find any info on it looking back.
8nvdf8	game	extra	reddit	Racing flash game, where you either come in first or destroy the other cars, and get better car.. Hey so I remember this great flash game I used to play when I was a kid \(game probably was released 2000\-2010\), it was a racing game where you either had to finish by coming in first by driving through these arc things \(so you wouldn't be able to drive across the middle of the racing field\) OR destroy all the other cars by ramming into them. When you won, you'd get the car that's one level above yours, like it would be faster or stronger, then you'd play again to get the next one. I loved that game, and I want to see if anyone knows the name? thanks
8nvh00	game	extra	reddit	[PC] [2005-2014] Text Based Escape Game With A Psychologically Manipulative AI Captor. Platform(s): This was a free, online game, on the website Kongregate. Genre: It was a text based, psychological horror, escape game. Estimated year of release: It came out before the year 2014, when I played it, and it had a modern enough concept to come out after 2005. I assume the second part, since I cannot give a definitive date. Graphics/art style: There were no pictures, since it was a text based game. But it was white text on a black background. Notable characters: The person you play in the game is supposed to be the actual you. There is also an AI, who hates they player, that's your captor. Notable gameplay mechanics: There were parts of the game where the player would type commands. Things like, ""look at box,"" or ""examine room,"" but if the player typed a command that wouldn't work, the AI would belittle them. There are different puzzles in the game, but the player had to always type the answer. [One of the the puzzles is guessing a number from 0 to 1,000 or 1,000,000. The player guess the number, and the AI tells the play to guess higher or lower. Each time the player get it wrong, the robot demeans them more.](#spoiler) Other details: The game is very depressing and nihilistic. During some part of the game, the AI says something like, [""You could be creative and write a book. Just like every other human in the world.""](#spoiler) The AI talks extensively about how the player is wasting time and is going to die. The goal is to escape the game, even with the AI constantly insulting the player. I remember I saw it on a blog called sixpenceee on Tumblr, but I cannot find the link anymore.
8nvuuz	game	extra	reddit	Level after level of boss battle that learned as you played. **Platform\(s\):** PC **Genre:** top\-down space shooter **Estimated year of release:** mid 2000's \(2007 at the latest\) **Graphics/art style:** I remember it being sort\-of wireframe **Notable characters:** your ship and a boss ship **Notable gameplay mechanics:** you controlled a ship that moved around the game window \(I think based on **wasd** or arrow keys\), and you shot endless bullets in an angle based on how far the mouse cursor was from your ship. The boss ship had a modular structure that you had to destroy before attacking its core to destroy it. The level ended when you destroyed it, and, when the next level began, the boss had changed itself depending on how you behaved in the last round. You had a certain amount of time to progress through the game, gaining time each time you beat the boss and losing time when you died. **Other details:** I remember getting the game just as an exe, so it may not have been a published thing.

Platform(s): PC only as far as I know Genre: Fantasy, first person Estimated year of release: I played a demo sometime 2002-2010 Graphics/art style: Good for the time, fairly standard visuals Notable characters: No idea Notable gameplay mechanics: Equipment had a durability rating, even in the demo, you got a sword or shield which was deemed 'Unbreakable' Other details: The only thing I can remember for sure about this game was that it was based on the engine of a really big FPS game, something like Half-Life 2, maybe? It's a first person fantasy along the lines of TES games. It's GFX were quite good, but the actual execution of the demo was a mess, IIRC.

It wasn't a gory game but the maps were all fire and shit. The soundtrack was also really power metal-ish.

I hope this is enough to go off of\-\-I'll try to remember more about what I saw.

I also had to find other stuff that game me access to other parts of the map: if I wanted to go into the water, I had to find a thing on the map that made me able to breath underwater and if I wanted to access higher platforms where I couldn't jump to, I had to find a jetpack. **Other details:** The game starts with MC going out of his space ship or something, then there is some text if I remember correctly but I really don't know what it said or what the purpose of the game really was, but I guess I had to make the ""space ship"" work again, I don't know.

8o8lka	game	extra	reddit	[PC][~2000][RPG] Diablo-like medieval top down RPG. *Platform(s): I played on PC and I believe it's an ""exclusive"" but I'm not sure. *Genre: Isometric real time RPG. Not really hack'n'slach like Diablo, but this title came first to my mind when I thought about my game. Similar to Sacred as well, but generally not that fast. *Estimated year of release: I guess I played it sometime in early 2000s, but I guess it might have came out earlier. *Graphics/art style: Trying to be realistic, but quite old. Nothing fancy, no stylized graphics or anything. Might have been pixelated, but it might as well be the low resolution I was playing on. *Notable characters: There was no character creation, but instead you had to choose from a set of 3 characters. Every one of them started in a different location. Might have been 3 different classes, but I'm not sure. Also, every character started with a different part of a talisman, which by the end of the game, was supposed to be put together. I don't know how it ends, because the game was very difficult for me at the time at the time for me *Notable gameplay mechanics: Nothing I remember besides the character part mentioned earlier. *Other details: I'm from Poland if it helps (I dunno, it might be a local game or something)
8o9yy8	game	extra	reddit	[TOMT] [Game] PC game from the 1990s - 2000s for children. I'm trying to find this game I played as a kid. I can't remember much, but it was a platformer, with graphics similar to Super Mario Bros but more defined. The colors weren't super saturated, and there was a level editor in addition to the main story (I think?) The gameplay was simple, you either had to collect a certain amount of coins, or reach the end of the level in order to beat a level. I'm not really sure, but I think I recall the main character looking kind of like an egg. That may or may not be accurate. There's probably more stuff I'm not remembering, but this has been troubling me for quite a while now. Thank you for any help!

You started out in a treehouse and could follow one of several different paths led by different girls. In one mini game you had to keep many Tibetan singing bowls going, and one where you had to catch a gold fish, another where you had to match stones I think? It was all mini game based and you gained moonstone? pieces whenever you beat a game. My sisters and I remember Moonlight Path as a possible name, but aren't convinced of our memories. Another key feature \(which makes me wonder if it was a cereal box game\) was that you could get a miniature purple backpack, in true 90's fashion. I remember it being from the very late 90's, but may have gotten it late.

8o92qu	game	extra	reddit	[NDS][played in 2008-2009] 2D rpg where you roll dice to go around. I don't remember much but any guesses are appreciated. This was a 2D, top down rpg. By top down, I remember there was a view of a map on the bottom screen, and this is where you could see your character, imagine what a monopoly game would look like. The top screen was for when you entered towns, yet you couldn't see inside the town, just a menu would appear and some houses on the background would show up. The menu in towns was things like: Buy Sell Steal I distinctly remember the steal option. It always carried a risk, and there'd be a small punishment but i dont know what it would be. And I think the currency was ""G"" I believe there was multiplayer because there were other cpu characters. The dice roll was like in mario party: you pressed a button and it rolled a dice for you. Unfortunately i dont remember anything about combat, and sorry about formatting, I am on mobile. Thanks in advance.

You fought other people who also started with three monsters. At the beginning of the game you were asked a series of questions to determine what kind of team you should start out with. The one I always wanted to start out with was a highly offensive team which had a big rock dude (i think) as one of the main guys.

I do remember that part of the game you could find pieces of a mosaic around the world which would fill in a picture. I was never able to beat the game, I don't know if that is because there was no end to the game or I was too young to figure out what I needed to do to beat it. I also don't remember if it was a card game or a game more like pokemon. Any help would be much appreciated. I want to try to find an emulator to play this game.

I remember a browser-based game where you started as a randomly selected person on the planet, and everything about you and most of the things that happened to you were driven by real-life statistics. So, for example, you'd have an 80% chance of starting in poverty, sex was pretty 50/50, starting country odds were proportional to that country's percentage of the world population, etc. etc. Probably would have played it some time between '07 and '09, was definitely free or at least had a free trial version, and I believe it was positioned as an educational classroom aid. The actual gameplay was fairly simplistic, you could choose profession, seek a romantic partner, try to move and such, and the outcomes of those actions were also driven by statistics. My memory of what it looked like isn't 100% clear, but I'm pretty sure you spent most of your time looking at a world map centered on your character and navigating menus to make various decisions as time progressed. Anyone have any clue?
8omthg	game	extra	reddit	[TOMT][GAME] Haunting simulator. I can't seem to find the title of this game I loved as a child. It was a PC game developed by EA (I believe, with their logo ""challenge everything""). It was some sort of pseudo 3D haunting simulator (or rather strategy/management game), where the goal was to scare people in a house (each house was a level and a story of its own). You had acces to different ghosts with their own abilities and special attacks, and new ones were unlocked at each level. I think that the more a ""scare"" meter was high, the more actions you could make your ghosts do. I think I got this game with my PC, as a gift from either AMD or Nvidia, not sure. Ah it was in the early/mid 2000s by the way. Any ideas?

Published on a website, I thought Tor, but I can't find it there. It's rules for a game about a genocide committed by humans, accidentally, simply by stepping foot on a planet. The game is played by placing a pad of paper and some pencils on a table in a room, then closing the door and never opening it again. As soon as it's opened, the game is immediately over.

8onclh	game	extra	reddit	Sega CD around 1994 or 1995, point and click. This was a point a click game that I believe was for the Sega CD. All I remember is that you were a cop who wore a trenchcoat. You start in his apartment? and have to put on clothes before leaving. The game will not let you leave without being fully dressed. The next area is a bar with two bouncers who will not let you in if you are armed. I remember that you -can- use your gun and shoot one of the bouncers but they beat you to death after. To get into the bar you have to go without your gun. Inside the bar, you speak to a man about a young lady who overdosed on some kind of drug. He seems genuinely shocked, and I *think* there was voice acting as well. Help me please! Thanks! &lt;3

8oomxj	game	extra	reddit	[TOMT] [Game] TWO 90's / 2000's computer games. In the Pajama Sam/ Spy Fox era. Relatively high resolution with very simple animation, probably the same developer for both. Played on a mac Color Desktop computer. 1st game: At least part takes place in a treehouse \(but its not the game ""The Treehouse""\). Theres a somewhat omniscient guide character and I think there were educational elements. In one corner of the treehouse you could listen to music, specifically La Cucaracha. At another place, you would get things from a vending machine, maybe by doing math or at least knowing your numbers. If you didn't get the right thing that the guide character asked for, he said ""That's NOT what I wanted"" 2nd game: Same style, the setting is inside a small house I think. The main game characters who guide the player are two big cartoon fairies, more Cosmo and Wanda than Tinkerbell. I think this one had educational elements as well. That's really all I remember, except that you clicked different locations around the room or out the back door to do different games/activities. Thank you!
8ooo6s	game	extra	reddit	[PC] [2000's] School Simulator Game for Kids, Likely Marketed Towards Girls Only. **Platform\(s\):** PC **Genre:** Most likely High School Simulator **Estimated year of release:** 2004 \- 2009, probably **Graphics/art style:** 3D and Brightly Colored, Similar in style to a Barbie game. I remember thinking it was pretty high quality for the time. **Notable characters:** The main character is \(I believe\) a customizable character and a teenage girl, and the other named characters that appear are four high school girls **Notable gameplay mechanics:** Comprised mainly of various mini\-games, as well as making choices and walking your character from location to location **Other details:** I'm trying to remember a game I was really fond of when I was younger. I don't remember a lot about this game other than very specific parts of it \(I have no idea what the overall objective of the game was\). From what I can recall, the game begins with your character \(who I believe is a girl just starting high school\) having a dream that is some sort of game show. Within the game show she's asked what she wants to do with the rest of her life, and this then sets up the plot of the game that you now need to choose an activity in high school. Your character has four friends who are stereotypical high school girls. One is in to sports, the other is into art, etc. etc. And you have to choose between trying out their activities. I remember there was a theatre portion of the game that revolved around setting up a production of Romeo and Juliet, and I believe the sports portion of the game took place at some form of summer camp. The game was likely marketed towards younger girls. I was in elementary school when this came out, so I don't believe it would be anything too sophisticated as far as gameplay and such. Also, this may be completely unrelated. But my memory tells me that this game is part of a bigger franchise, although I'm 100&amp;#37; sure it's not a Barbie game. I believe there was also a clothing line sold at Kohls in relation to this game with like collections based around the four friend characters. Although, I wouldn't rely to much on this information because I'm not sure if my mind is remembering it wrong.

8ora5q	game	extra	reddit	[PC] [2000's] Two free browser MMO games made by the same company. **Platform(s):** PC **Genre:** One was a fantasy MMORPG, the other one was a social MMO **Estimated year of release:** 2002 - 2008 I guess **Graphics/art style:** 3D, similar to all cookie-cutter free MMOs **Notable gameplay mechanics:** The fantasy RPG was like the average games of the genre - spawn in a dark fantasy world, create your character, collect equipment and kill stuff. The social game was similar, you made a character (which always looked like a normal human) and played in open world where you could chat with other people and socialize, it didn't have much gameplay. **Other details:** I remember there was a colosseum of some sort in the fantasy game. Also, in the social game, you could customize and drive your own car. Both of the game were made by the same company and could be played through the same website I think.
8orlqp	game	extra	reddit	[PC][2000-2010ish]A game that is part puzzle and part mystery where you a re a character who is trying to figure out what happened to her family.

They have the same name I believe one just has a 2 on the end I think **Platform(s):** I know for a fact I pyplayed it on a PC that potentially had windows XP on it. I may have also played it years later on windows 95 or windows 7. **Genre:** The game is a puzzle, find the object to complete the puzzle but the puzzle does not have a bar along the bottom with shadows or images of what you are finding. **Estimated year of release:** I remember playing it somewhere it between 2000 and 2010 but the actual release date I am not sure **Graphics/art style:** I think that the colors are somewhat muted and the game is appeared to be lit by sunlight from the windows. **Notable characters:** The mainn character is a girl/woman who I don't think you ever actually see. It is first person perspective and there is a husband who I cant remember meeting. **Notable gameplay mechanics:** One of the big elements is searching for hidden pieces of what I think is stained glass in each level and if you get all the pieces you unlock part of the story. In one scene you are collecting marbles or something small and round. **Other details:** I am going to describe in detail the scenes I have in my head. One of them you come out a, I think your Childs room, and are on a bridge between your house and your parents house with your daughters tree house in the middle. to unlock the door of your parents house you need to collect all the colored crayons and fill in the drawings that were on your daughters tree house. In another scene you are in the main area of the house with the stairs leading up to the top floor. There is a silhouetted picture on the wall and for some reason I am remembering a piano of some kind. In a third scene you are in the backyard and collecting things but I cant remember why, maybe to get into the main floor of the house. I think that the game begins with a C or an S but I am not sure. Also I am pretty sure it is made by Big Fish Games, or at least I remember playing it on there and then having it ask me to pay for it.

The game was kind of a sandbox where you could pick a hat for your character and drop in dummies and shoot with different weapons. A name for the video game or series would be greatly appreciated. My brother and i used to play it like 10 years ago.
8ov66h	game	extra	reddit	Not sure what console or year, what Sonic game was I playing (if any)?. Way back in the day, I had picked up one of those possibly-bootleg TV-plugin consoles with 30 or so Sega games on it. One of the included games was simply dubbed ""Sonic,"" and I had never actually seen it before. The game used the Genesis assets, and all I can remember was the first boss being a flying turtle robot that requires you to turn into a ball mid-jump (you used bounce pads to reach him) to avoid taking damage while you hit him. It was all-around pretty shoddy quality, but the assets were unique and clearly matched the Sega style. Anyone know what Sonic game I might have been playing?

Your wife or girlfriend dies so you ascend stairs in a building intending to jump off to kill yourself, but instead you float up into the stars and fly around and then I think eventually become a star along with your dead s/o. It was one of those really somber bummer games and possibly the name referenced stars, not certain.
8ovwa2	game	extra	reddit	[TOMT] Flash Based Strategy Game with Rectangular Characters. There is a game that my best friend and I used to play. We think we played it on a PC online from miniclip. The game had a rectangular character and it started in a house (maybe a kitchen). It was one of the games where you had to solve each level to get to the next, but there was also a story element. There was a trilogy of this game (possibly more if they came out after we lost interest). We think we remember there being a death that you had to solve, possibly the mother of the house you start in. There are puzzles that involved shapes on the floor and stepping on a certain part of the floor to change the color. You had to do it in the right order/pattern to move to the next level. There were also ones that involved keypads and an old TV. One level you had to plug a cord into the wall to turn on the TV. Then there was a tape in the TV that had a recording on it, possibly from a security camera in the house. One level, you had to turn on hot water to make the mirror fog up and reveal a code for one of the keypads. I believe you could have an inventory. There was also a circular ish room that had doors all around it. This was around 2006\-2010 (give or take). The graphics were simple but the story elements made it a rather interesting game. Also, I can still remember exactly the sound of the light switches being turned on (big aspect of some of the levels) and the faucet being turned. Things like that. Please help!! We must knowwwww!! And thank you so much!

8p1glq	game	extra	reddit	[TOMT][COMPUTER GAME]: You looked for dinosaur blueprints, as a scientist in a dinosaur's body. This was the 90s. I think the game was on DOS. You played a scientist. Some other scientist had hid the blueprints for a dinosaur across time (all periods with dinosaurs in them, you weren't, like, visiting the Louvre.) You got into a time machine, picked what dinosaur you wanted to be, and then went into each dinosaur-time-period to find the blueprint that was hidden there. Along the way, you had to locate food and water to keep the dinosaur healthy, and fight off other dinosaurs who attacked you.
8p2sw0	game	extra	reddit	[TOMT] a short show/video that possibly came with a dungeons and dragons game with a weird scorpion guy?.

It was live action with some shoddy effects/cgi. Any help?
8p3bcy	game	extra	reddit	A game I played on the GameCube. I played this game in the early 2000s.

I also think the game came out on other platforms as well.
8p3svp	game	extra	reddit	[2010's] A dark FPS I saw at some GDQ event. **Platform(s):** PC or new generation consoles **Genre:** Horror/FPS **Estimated year of release:** 2010-2017 **Notable gameplay mechanics:** **Other details:** It was a first person perspective game with good 3d graphics, it's definitely not old, I would say 5 years old at most. The game had a very dark, hellish atmosphere, everything around was hideous, slimy and looked like an inside of a living creature. Walls seemed like an abomination of something alive, colored light brown and red, everything was living. I remember keys used to solve puzzles were like living tentacles and I think grabbed a players hand. Lots of stuff looked like a mix of an object with a living creature. I'm almost sure I saw it on some GDQ event (last 2 years) and I was amazed that such an original game isn't too widely known. It reminded me of ""The Thing"" a little bit. Any help will be very much appreciated

8p4bds	game	extra	reddit	[PS4][2014-2016]Cartoony, surreal platformer (sorry, vague). **Platform(s):**PS4 **Genre:**Platformer **Estimated year of release:**I would guess around 2014-2016 **Graphics/art style:**Cartoony, 2D. Possible hand drawn assets. I just remember the art style was cartoony and surreal, kind of like something you would see in Rocko's modern life. Overall, it had a sort of comedic and surreal vibe to it. **Notable characters:**I could be off, but I think you just played some sort of cartoony looking dude. I feel like your character was not supposed to be special or heroic in any way. **Notable gameplay mechanics:** I remember it was a platformer, possibly with some unique gameplay mechanic. Sorry, I do not remember any other specifics :( **Other details:** I think it was an indie game, and I am 99% sure it was free on PS+ at one point.

8p5lcz	game	extra	reddit	PC 1995-2005 (I think) Mutant oriented game where you fight your way out in small group. Ok so basically I have snippets of information that i remembered. Game was a shooter like game if my memory is correct. It was something about people becoming mutants and you control 4? Characters I believe and have to fight those mutants to get out of town...I think... Style wisely I have in mind something like diablo 2.... fight wisely something more like heroes of might and magic 2... but something tells me it was not turn based. Similarly to diablo 2 it had a view from above. When it comes to characters, something tells me the main characters were soldiers but I can be wrong. One thing I remember for sure, and only reason I remember this game is that at one point you meet an infected mutant/human dude who repeats a phrase ""Riding a snake"" (now, that's a rough translation from polish ""jeździć na wężu"" since I played it in Polish). The dude then later does change into an evil one, summons some smaller mutants etc, so initially you could have picked an easier fight at the start when you had a choice whether to take him as a companion or kill him. I was a kid back when I played it with my father and the game just faded from our memory, except the riding the snake guy, if anyone has any idea or just if you remember something similar but not the name, I'll just add that as a clue for when I search for it next time. It's been years that I search for this game but never too actively. Thank you for help. P.s. take everything I wrote with a grain of salt, I might be wrong in some aspects, if you remember anything similar, just comment, even if it's different from what I described. I might have just forgotten what it looked like.

8p6bii	game	extra	reddit	[PC (at least)][Past Year or Still In Development] Horror/Mystery About Neighborhood Kids Solving Brainwashing. Just found this sub and am trying to remember a game I saw from a trailer/promo video from several months back, so some details are vague. The game **""Hello Neighbor""** is reminiscent of this game, but lacks some key characteristics I recall from the video (described below). **Platform(s):** PC (could be supported on others...) **Genre:** Horror / Mystery. **Estimated year of release:** Possibly within the past 3-6 months, though it may still be in development (or cancelled). **Graphics/art style:** Really hard to describe with the dark setting and how long it's been since seeing the video. 3D, but can't really comment on specifics because of the quick scenes and shortness of the clip... **Notable characters:** Men in white, clan-like clothes appeared in the clip for a split-second. Hoods and all, but not related to KKK activity. That was the one detail I remember very vividly. **Notable gameplay mechanics:** Don't recall a lot of specifics, but I think radios and bikes were involved (made me think the game was reminiscent/inspired by ""Stranger Things"") **Other details:** It was a short video I saw a few months back (up to a year ago). The video was set at night in a suburban/rural street. I thought the kids solving the problem rode bikes. The game felt inspired by Stranger Things, though had no related plot elements. The plot shown in the video revolved around a mystery of disappearances, maybe brainwashing too (I think it was happening to the parents/adults). Video shows quick scenes of moving through passageways, people in white robes (think KKK-like...). Was about a small group of kids determined to solve the mystery. I don't believe it was the game Hello Neighbor, given what I recall from the video and what I've seen from that game, but it is reminiscent of this unknown game. Been trying to recall this game for months now (and it's driving me nuts), so I hope we can figure it out. Thanks!
8p6qn6	game	extra	reddit	[TOMT][90's PC GAME] Please help me find this game. This has been bugging me for ever. So, i can remember 2 things about this game. 1. You had to control 2 characters (i think) and you are sliding down a slide (i think it was a tongue?) and if you fell off either side you'd be on a different path. Both characters could fall off either ends i believe. I can't remember if it was 2D or 3D but i think it was 3D. 2. Im not even sure if this is the same game but i remember a girl telling me all the vowels and how y could sometimes be a vowel and that every letter has a vowel. Her hint being ""i'd start with A or E, if i were you."" Sorry i know this isn't much to go on at all but if anyone knows what this game(s) is please let me know, its driving me crazy haha! I'd be very much appreciative!
8p6tsa	game	extra	reddit	[TOMT] An Internet game with jelly things. I used to play this game online probably around 10 years ago. It was a turn-based game on a grid where you could direct jelly type things around. You would obtain power ups (I remember dropping an anvil and calling an air strike specifically) until the opponent jellies were dead. Pretty sure you could play against other people as well as against the computer. I think the title has the word “jelly” in it but not 100% sure.
8p7rw8	game	extra	reddit	[TOMT] [VIDEO GAME] Only remember some of the beginning.... I've had this game in the back of my mind for a while now. I was maybe six (Far too young, but older friends didn't care to let me play) when I played it, on the original Xbox. Anyways, my issue is that I don't even know if it was real anymore, almost like a foggy dream. But who knows. It starts along the lines of being in an apartment, in a city. Some people are after you, so you gotta go. There's this guy (a plumber?) That you kill with a wrench. A big red one. The game was definitely first person. After you escape, you go to the sewers, and it reminds me a lot of the Theives Guild from Slyrim when I recall it, like how it looked. The game had loading screens to, because I remember after comepleting the escape part there is concept art of the sewer area as you load. I think it was like either a dystopia, or you were framed or something. Maybe I'm just crazy, but I swear I remember it so vividly, but it's so foggy and distant at the same time. I don't know where else to post this. Hope it is real though, thanks in advance. Sorry I don't have any more details.
8p9l1z	game	extra	reddit	NES/SNES a Super Mario game where there was a level that had a hidden block trap pit.. Like halfway through the level you could fall into this boxed in section, and when you tried jumping out, you couldn't because the opening was lined with invisible blocks. You were intended to jump over that section entirely I think. Also I kind of remember there was a koopa in there with you just walking around. The invisible block ceiling was low enough that you couldn't jump over him. This was in the early 90s and played on official hardware. Not a flash game or rom hack, unless my dad was some kind of wizard who possessed the ability to play hacks on the real console.
8p40sq	game	extra	reddit	[AppleII][Mid80s]Text-Based Adventure/Exploration Game. Platform(s): Apple II Genre: Text-Based Adventure/Exploration Game Estimated year of release: Sometime in the Mid to late 80s Graphics/art style: Very simple line/vector graphics above a text description and text input prompt Notable characters: Some sort of pyramid on the loading/intro scene, and a very short snippet of what you could call ""voice synthesis"" - a laugh, maybe? Notable gameplay mechanics: I seem to recall that you were trapped in some sort of ancient structure, and the only way to escape was to discover a bunch (12 different ways, perhaps?) of innovative ways to kill yourself. There was a god-like antagonist, and he was trying to keep you alive and prevent that from happening. Other details: It's been at least 30 years since I played this game as a child, and all my recollections are super vague. The salient points I remember were a very basic voice synthesis on the loading screen, and the goal being to figure out different ways to kill yourself, and a deity trying to prevent that. This game has been bugging me for a really long time, and I'm still not quite certain if the game actually exists, or if it was a dream I had at some point in time. Really old memories are like that.

The creator became a born-again-christian and vowed to never make any more games to get in the way of his faith. This game was definitely on Kongregate and Newgrounds, and it has medals on Newgrounds for sure. I'd like to do a video about this but it's just so weird it's difficult to figure out.

Instead of pure racing the goal was more to manoeuvre through tight spaces, avoiding walls etc. I remember there being just three paths (left/middle/right) and you had to be quick to get to the end. **Other details:** I bought it in one of those bargain bins full of floppy disks, so it could be a lot older than the date I got it. It was a small simple game. Thanks!

8pc7c9	game	extra	reddit	PC Help with horror game I saw on the HGN twitch channel a few days ago. Platform(s): PC? Genre: Horror Estimated year of release: No idea Graphics/art style: Not great, looked like an indie game. Notable characters: A criminal was killed by a pipe piercing his eye. He appeared in a level as a gift demon type thing, and where he was looking was shown in a red haze, so you could avoid his gaze. Notable gameplay mechanics: A ghost girl thing that could kill you would move through walls by way of black portals. In another level, the giant demon thing had to be avoided, until you could give him an offering and he left. Part of the game was in an apartment or home that you shared with your wife. The TV messed up and counted down from 100 to 13, creepy stuff like that. I think the wife was missing maybe? Other details: I saw this game on a twitch channel called Horror Gaming Network. The problem is he only ever lists the game he's playing as Resident Evil, even when he's not. This was on a few mornings ago. (I ""watch"" while I work each day.) I want to find this game and play it, it looked kind of fun, but I can't figure out what it was. Seemed like it could have been Korean maybe? The ghost girl that could kill you was asian, and the writing in the game seemed Korean, but I can't be sure. Any help would be great, this has been bugging me for three days.

Platform(s): PC/Dos Genre: Jigsaw Puzzle Solving Game Estimated year of release: Early 90s - On floppy disk Graphics/art style: VGA - very colorful and artistic Notable characters: n/a Notable gameplay mechanics: The game was a series of jigsaw-like puzzles on the screen. You had to use the mouse cursor to drag puzzle pieces around until they fit together with other pieces. While doing this, the background of the puzzle pieces continued to move. It was fun and a bit disorienting. Essentially, the puzzles you had to solve involved moving images. Other details: The music score was outstanding. That was the most memorable part of the game. I also remember one of the puzzles backgrounds was of 3 balls rotating in a three-dimensional plane. I could be wrong, but I seem to remember the name of the company/publisher starting with the letter C, and it was similar to ""Claris"".

8pj3x5	game	extra	reddit	Cult-like choose-your own story film game. I'm not sure why but the template hasn't popped up like "" **PSA: A guide to better results** "" said it would. (so I copied pasted it instead) **Platform(s):** I think it's played on a computer. I'm somewhat confident that this is only played on the computer (not on playstation or x\-box, or at the very least when I played it/watched a lets play of it\- and this was likely in the year that it came out) **Genre:** Pretty sure it was in first\-person. Horror\-like. Choose your own story game\- plays like a film where every once in a while the story pauses (I think the visuals might not freeze\- instead the actors simply kind of just stay idle), you must make a choice. (I guess that makes it a role\-playing, choose your own story, horror game). **Estimated year of release:** I think between 2013\-2016. My best guess would be 2015. **Graphics/art style:** It's literally just real\-life actors acting. It's not real\-looking people (i.e. it's not one of those games that's used actors to model very real looking digital characters\- it's not like Until Dawn, for example\- at least I don't think so). It's actually just human beings in the flesh\- actors, and real trees, a real house\- art\-style is just someone filming inside a house, and then outside in the dark in a foresty area. I guess it's quite dark\- maybe like a black\-mirrorish vibe. The story is set during some house party\- so it's dark\- outside, but theres you know like dim\-ish lighting inside (party lights rather than just normal house lights). And when you do end up going outside later in the story it is dark outside. **Notable characters:** I'm not great at describing characters. I remember this one white guy, lanky, maybe the slightly nerdy and eccentric type. I'm not sure, but I don't think he ends up the evil guy in the end. The characters are all teens (or young adults). **Notable gameplay mechanics:** I mentioned it in the ""Genre"". This is almost not a game. I mean it is, but it's basically a choose your own story\- but instead of a book\- it's a (short) film. Short meaning like finishing the game probably takes half an hour. Maybe an hour... if you take a long time to make choices? Theres also a chance that I didn't actually play the whole thing/didn't watch someone play the whole thing\- and there were more ""episodes"" of this game. I don't believe your character is given a voice actor\- after you click on a choice\- the characters that were talking to you/are around you act as if you've just said the choice you made. For example: Mark: Should we try opening the door? \* You are presented with a choice of saying ""I think...we should wait here. Let's calm down"" or ""Fuck it. Let's go!"" \* \* You clicked on ""Fuck it. Let's go!"" \* Mark: Oh shit, you're one balsy motherfucka. I might be wrong, but I think this was the case, because the point of the game was really to make you feel like you were inside the game\- that the visuals you're seeing is what the character is seeing\- the game is played through your perspective as the player\- the player is the protagonist. For example, I think they make a point to get the actors to speak to you\- and their eyes look directly at the camera when they speak to your character. **Other details:** (Note: Some of these details might be made up, but I'm trying my best). I believe I first watched this game\- then played it (first watched it on someone's YouTube channel). There's a good chance it was GeekRemix\- the channel I watch 90&amp;#37; of the let's plays that I watch. However, I've tried for an hour to find it there but I can't (maybe it got taken down?)\- and it's not too easy, I could have missed it\- they have a lot of videos. I think the first main scene takes place in the living room of this house party\- you're standing by the couch, and you're talking to two or three people\- there might be a bitchy blonde chick who you have to decide whether or not to do something bad to her\- like put something in her drink or cut her hair or play a prank on her. I remember shortly after, you can end up in the kitchen, but I don't remember why. I think I vaguely remember a brief scene/moment where you take a breather and go outside the house (into like a small backyard?) and I think you accidentally walk in on two guys kissing (two white guys? similar height? fully clothed). And I think they get embarassed. They might've been fairly straight looking guys (You know, like you wouldn't assume they were gay/seem straight enough) I think one of the main characters\- like a close\-friend, side\-kickish type\- kind of really jittery white dude, thin, not particularly short, possibly ginger\- probably blond, is written to seem almost a little too obvious as the killer/evil person (I think we find someone dead early in the game\- not really sure I'm guessing here). And in the end I don't believe he ends up being the killer/evil person\- though his overly jittery, pushy, and kinda large(?) personality really is meant to make you question him. I also feel like at one point we leave the house and furiously go banging on someone else's house\- like a neighbours maybe. And end up getting inside\- two or three other teens/young\-adults answer it (but I am very doubtful of this memory\- theres a chance this is from something completely different). I think other people try to get inside after us (you \+ maybe that jittery suspicious friend of yours) through that door you entered through\- in your neighbours house. I believe the end scene is you wake up\- youve been caught by the evil person/people, have been tied up, and are now in a foresty area\- its quite dark, and some kind of cultish plotline is happening. I think it's also being filmed by people and put on social media/being shared, kinda like Black Mirror or the movie Nerve (not sure I might be making this ""being filmed"" part up). I think the purpose of this cultlike group (I think they were wearing typical cult robes with hoodies) is to like teach some kind of social media lesson\- something about teaching teenagers a lesson\- Im not sure\- some kind of moral lesson relevant to modern society. Reminder: (Note: Some of these details might be made up, but I'm trying my best). Have I posted this in the right place? I really would love to know what this memory is of. Its driving me insane. (Not literally, butt...)
8pjnk5	game	extra	reddit	[TOMT]Name of an old pc game. It was a rail shooter on pc. At least around 12 years old. I remember it as a horror rail shooter where you walked in a mansion or something like that and you had monsters and zombie popping up on screen. I know that there was an option to change the blood's colour to green or purple (or maybe the weapons ammo could be changed green or purple, I remember seeing these colours when shooting, so it's either the blood or the ammo).

It was story driven I believe and in many missions you would have a base with shields and turrets, along with automatically spawning friendly units. The enemy base would also do the same. You won the level by defeating the enemy base, and would win the mission by defeating the base. Other missions wouldnt include the base mechanic and you would need to get from point a-b without dying. I cannot remember if you could control this in anyway yourself or if it was automatic. **Other details:** Your character felt small compared to the world (i remember it like that anyway) I also remember there being a free demo that only let you play 1-2 missions but you had to pay for the full game I'm hoping some of the things im remembering are not over-exaggeration based on young me's memory.

8q4kpq	game	extra	reddit	[Miniclip/Flash][Playing during late 2000s to early 2010s] Side-scrolling action-adventure game that’s kinda like Metroid Prime. Platform(s): Flash game on the Miniclip website Genre: Side-scrolling action-adventure game; think Metroid Prime Estimated year of release: No clear estimated time of release; I just recall playing it around the late 2000s to early 2010s. Graphics/art style: Typical 16-bit art style; I’m pretty sure the color scheme revolved around warm colors, particularly orange. Notable characters: You played as a generic space-marine-hunter-whatever guy, who I think had a grey-colored suit. The only other characters in the game were alien organisms, who served as the enemies. Notable gameplay mechanics: It basically played like Metroid Prime, so you would walk round, jump, and shoot in 8 directions, and I believed you could acquire upgrades too. Other details: I remember the title screen being rather unsettling. You would see an image of two halves of a face that each were from two separate faces; one half being the protagonist’s, in his mask, I think, and the other being a creepy alien’s. These two halves were combined to make one whole face. If you didn’t understand that, then try imagining a Two-Face style face, with one half belonging to the protagonist’s, and the other belong to an alien’s. There was also a black background for the title screen.

8q5njr	game	extra	reddit	2d Isometric game resembling Planescape Torment. I even bought Planescape torment thinking it was it. It was not.. Platform(s):PC Genre: Isometric rpg but I don't remember any combat. Point and click adventure Estimated year of release: 1998 ~ Graphics/art style: Pre Rendered isometric backgrounds that look like Planescape torment, the Baldur games, etc. Notable characters: There was some tentacle monster in a pumpkin patch the npcs were talking about. Notable gameplay mechanics: I don't remember any combat. It was point and click and you had to find items so the npc stories would progress. This was all per area though, you didn't have to go between areas to get the items. The tentacle vines pumpkin patch area had houses around and families or groups of people, and you had to find random items for them. I think you had no idea who you were and that was what the little quests revealed. Other details: I didn't beat it and this vine, pumpkin patch area is all i remember, and that's if there were any pumpkins at all.

8q5ux2	game	extra	reddit	[TOMT] Open world video game similar to GTA.. When I was a kid, there was a game I used to watch my friend play that was an open world shooter that took place in some sort of big city. I believe it was somewhat like GTA except not (obviously or else I wouldn't be here). The protagonist was a female, however, I think they had customizable characters since I remember constantly asking him if I could customize his character so don't trust me on that. Another detail I remember was that if you had a jet and flew out far enough, you could visit an offshore island in the shape of a star? I believe it was also abandoned. I'm more than positive it was made after 2006 since it was PS3 game.

8q7bhz	game	extra	reddit	[TOMT][GAME] Old video game where you deliver pizza with pulleys. Hey! I just happen to remember a REALLY old video game I used to play in elementary school... I played the game back in 2003, though this game is probably much older. It was on a old (maybe apple?) computer without a GUI, and used a floppy disk In this game, the goal was to deliver pizzas, using a system of pulleys. If anyone possibly knows, it would really be great! Thanks in advance!
8q7jo0	game	extra	reddit	[TOMT][Video Game] Old-school computer game where you were a tank capturing flags.. I used to play this on our old Macintosh computer (no disc, that I know of, seemed to come with it, it was just there, as a default; we did not have internet). I was playing it probably around 1997, but definitely pre-1999. You were a red polygon-esque tank on this black map where there were just dim-yellow blocks/pyramids as landscape or ""buildings."" The edge of the map would be lined by dim-yellow dots on the map that would extend out in lines as far as you can see; if you tried to move out of the map, you'd just vibrate as you made a weird noise. You'd just go around this place and run over a dim-yellow flag and flagpole to continue to a new level that was about the same. Sometimes you'd run into other tanks, but I think they were triangular? You'd shoot at them until they ""died,"" by way of ""waving"" out of existence, similar to an image being rippled out of water, if that makes sense. You'd shoot square ammo at each other that I think was neon-green, and if you got hit, it sounded like a dull metal *thunk*. Your enemies would usually be announced by what sounded like a slightly robotic/monotonous voice saying, ""Hello, man"" (at least that's what it sounded like). You had a circular map of your area on the corner of the screen. Game always defaulted to taking up the entire screen. Not very good animation, definitely trying to be 3-D with really cheap, blocky graphics. But I used to love that game.

It had multiplayer, and one of the heroes was a bulky African American I believe.

8q9duc	game	extra	reddit	PC game from 1998-2000ish with a black ninja-esque character, guns, and running.. Hi guys, Been trying to figure out the name of this game I used to play on PC when I was young: Platform: PC (grew up in a commonwealth country so couldve been a british game but I am pretty sure it was an American game) Genre: It was mostly a FPS but also couldve been a 3rd person. Maybe not only a shooter, could have been adventure but mostly shooting. Year of release: I played it concurrently with Star Wars Pod Racing so I am guessing between 1997-2001 Notable Characters: Main character was a guy who resembled a black ninja. Definitely had his face covered in all black Gameplay: Would have a gun and would run at high speed through metals doors. Like a Halo/Call of Duty/ Mass Effect hybrid Details: The graphics were pretty realistic for the time period. It's name was MK Ultra or something like Ultra with the letters M if I remember. This has been driving me crazy for a decade as I loved this game and would love to figure this out! Thanks

This 3D game basically has you as a sort of god that picks up sand into a ball and places it back down to form routes for humans(?) with masks that walk along to a set goal (cave?). It was on the Xbox 360 and had a playable demo, which is why I yearn for this game, but I can't remember the name. I believe that sand is not the only thing that can be picked up and is just the first thing that can be controlled, but these materials that are put down can also block paths of overflowing water and lava to make a new path appear.

8q96w5	game	extra	reddit	[PC][Around 1990]I think it was called ""Realms"". It was a dialog-heavy RPG fantasy game where you'd build your team before the game would start. It had bad UI.. **Platform(s):** PC/Mac **Genre:** Western RPG with Strategy Elements **Estimated year of release:** 1980-1995, but I'm pretty sure it's around 1990. **Graphics/art style:** 2d representational art assets. I recall some of the models being stretched out so that some of the monsters would take up multiple tiles. Most characters took up only 1 tile. **Notable characters:** You got to make your entire party and there were a TON of options. Fairy Battlemages, Devil Bards, Vampire Mages, Gnomes, Brownies the list goes on... **Notable gameplay mechanics:** You move around an overworld and get into turn based battles. Sometimes it's an encounter and sometimes its scripted. I recall you could drastically alter some of the fights by talking them into or out of them. The UI was also terrible. Everything was dropdown bars. **Other details:** I recall the sound effects being short as though all the sound came from a sampler. I can still hear the generic evil laugh that goes at you on the way out.

I believe it was newish at the time so I'd say around 2012. **Graphics/art style:** Very artsy. Glowy kind of bleached colors. I remember a pure white tree (I think). It off a light vibe. **Notable characters:** I believe the only playable character was a pear shaped orange guy. Again, he was glowy and kind of bleached orange. I think his limbs were thin like a stick figure's. **Notable gameplay mechanics:** Only mechanic was that it was a point and click. **Other details:** It was free. The movement reminds me of limbo. Kind of weighted if that makes any sense. I don't my dad got it off of steam. This is as much detail as I can remember without any prompts. If you have any questions that might give more detail, please ask. Thank you.
8qc1kh	game	extra	reddit	[PC/Browser] 2-D Cartoon style game in which you are a white ghost that possesses various objects around the house to scare away the people.. I played it sometime in the early to mid 2010’s. The title says it all. The ghost would make stereotypical “oooh” ghost noises fairly often. I do believe there was a sequel released that had multiple levels with many different objects to possess. There were also “key targets” in each level that you have to scare to the point of death, at which point, their ghost becomes a usable character costume. There was also a fear bar at the bottom of the screen that would display the atmosphere in the house, from normal to uneasy to scary to terrifying.
8qcc53	game	extra	reddit	[PC][1990s]Racing game in the style of ""Whacky Races"" but with no actual racing. Hi guys, hope you can help me out. I have been looking for this for quite some time and can't figure out the name of the game I am looking for. Essentially I am looking for a racing game which did not use any classic racing mechanics at all. You did not race around in 2D or 3D, but you had an overworld on which you had to reach certain locales all around the world, like in Gumball 3000/Cannonball races. The game was in bird's-eye-perspective and played pretty much like a board game. It had a racing setting comparable to that old ""Whacky Races"" cartoon. If I remember correctly, there were traps/weapons one could use. I can't remember if you had to throw dice or determined movement in another way. I am pretty sure that it was a game running on Win95, but it could have been earlier, maybe even MS-DOS. Platform: PC (MS-DOS/Win 3.1/Win95) Genre: Racing / Board Game Year: most probably 1990s Graphics/art style: Colourful, cartoonish Cheers and thx for your help

I remember the last level of the game was you going to the “thirteenth room” and fighting your nemesis in a huge metal bear. At the end of it, he gets electrocuted or something and turns into a hideous monster and flies off. You, now that you’ve got your bear back, decide to ignore that and go home to bed. It was a delightfully adorable game, and I’d like to find it again, if just purely for nostalgic purposes.

8qiell	game	extra	reddit	Need help finding a game. This morning I found a particularly interesting video in my Twitter feed about a new 1st person, 3d 'mining' game where the player is in an open world, si-fi themed environment and tasked with creating an industrial complex of items and objects including, refineries, conveyor belts, giant maglev trains, dune buggy like vehicles, supply drops, etc. The two environments shown in the video were a jungle/forest area and a dusty wasteland. The video also showed at least 3 others helping out the 4th when all of them created chain saws and cut down the trees behind them for resources. I should also point out that the game is Not voxel based, and based on my memory from this morning I don't even know if it's in full release or not. The only issue is apparently Twitter doesn't always have the same 'things you might like' tabs across multiple devices so it's not on my current devices feed. The game seemed fairly interesting but I can't remember the name. If anyone could help that would really be appreciated. Edit: Solved (Satisfactory)
8qip08	game	extra	reddit	[TOMT] [GAME] TITLE OF GAME IVE BEEN TRYING TO THINK OF FOR YEARS PLEASE HELP. I would play this video game with my brothers and his friends, so I want to say up to about 6-8 people could play? Each person had a bright coloured kinda ... tracksuit? Each a different colour. When I imagine it, it’s a big tower that goes up, kind of like a cork screw, and you jumped over hurdles as you tried keeping up with the tower turning as you go up it. It was probably a stupid mini game or something and I couldn’t even tell you what console it was on, but I want some sort of reassurance I didn’t make this game up in my mind! I’d say I played the game around 2005 maybe? If that helps

8qkht1	game	extra	reddit	A 2-D semi-text based, strategy, survival, post-apocalyptic game.. I remember playing this game for a while but i can not recall what the name of it was. It was a game where you began in some kind of cryogenic freezing lab. After you get out of your freezer you see a monster which you can either attack, fall back or hide. The game was based on hexagons and was heavily about realism where you needed to do stuff like: heat the water in order to keep the bacteria away. The looting was like a drag into squares in your inventory like in games like Diablo. (You even get some glass shards as weapon after you get out of your freezer. And you can find a knife if you loot the place you started in.) Oddly enough i remember reading a steam review of the game where the guy said something in the lines of: ""I lived for hundereds of hours but i died because i was too lazy to heat the water"".

8qlcs1	game	extra	reddit	PC Robot/Mech fighting game. I'm looking for a game that I played a demo version of years ago. The game is probably from about 2003-2006. My memory is foggy about this one, so I can be mistaken about something. In the demo you played a robot or mech, camera was third person, free look. NOT tekken-like. You were put in something that looked like a pretty empty arena (portal games come to my mind?) where you fought the enemy. Now, I don't remember if there were only 1 on 1 fights, or more. You could hit with melee attacks, I don't remember if you could shoot. It could have a tutorial in the beginning that took place on the 'arena', I don't know if later on there were other areas. Also, I played this game only myself, but now I have an idea that it might have been multi-player? Sorry for the lack of details. I hope you find it 😊 Edit: The game looked very similar to Garrison: Archangel. But Garrison is from 2018 so it's not that one.

I'm not sure if there was much more to it than that or if I just didn't get very far into it.
8qog4i	game	extra	reddit	[TOMT][BOARDGAME] 1950s-60s Scrolling around-the-world jet-plane race game (x-post from /r/boardgames). There was a game at my grandparents house that was a race around the world, with painted metal jet tokens, and the board was a side-scroller. Yes, literally a scroll of paper, and the jets sat on a cellophane window while the terrain was scrolled underneath. You could maneuver some on the window, but most of the cards(?) made the board move. And you tried to hit various cities for points, but avoid things like ""Monsoon"", etc. Unfortunately, my cousin thought the cellophane was wrapping and he tore it off, and the game got discarded... and I can't recall the name at all. I've looked on BGG, but haven't been able to find it. It's not ""Global Air Race"" or ""Air Race"" and I don't know that the name was anything like that.

8qowwj	game	extra	reddit	[TOMT]What 2D videogame (possibly educational) has three giants and human ambassadors?. In programming class the teacher had a games file to reward students who finished their lessons. There was this one game that I thought was called Reuse where you controlled three giants on a circular world to rebuild it after it died. It may have been an educational game, and I think it was 2015 or 16. The plot of the game was that there are three giants that rebuild the world each time it dies, then they hibernate until the world dies again. I can't remember the giants names, but there was a water giant, a leafy giant, and a stone giant if I recall correctly. The player controls the giants on a circular world each level. The water giant can create oceans, the stone giant makes mountains, and the leaf giant creates life. Each level had different problems to solve to get more powers for the giants. For example, the water giant makes an ocean so the forest giant can make a forest, and if you put a mountain in the forest you create a desert on the other side of it. Eventually there are humans on your world that make settlements and have ambassadors that can ride on the giants shoulders. That's as far as I got in the game before I moved to another town and stopped thinking about the weird game ever again. Now I want to find it, but with such a generic title, and limited information, I can't find it. Maybe the developer team was named Reuse, or perhaps it was just that the world was being reused. I really don't know. I would recognize images or video of the game in an instant though. I'm too poor to offer gold or anything, but whomever solves this is a great help.
8qq8v3	game	extra	reddit	[PS1][Year unknown]Running game in a room?. **Platform(s):** PS1 I believe. **Genre:** I don't remember the genre, but it seemed like racing? But the characters were running... **Estimated year of release:** Given it's a PS1 game, I have to say mid 90s. Don't remember the exact year. **Graphics/art style:** Hard to describe, but I remember the characters being ""tiny"" in comparison to the rest of the environment. The best environment I can recall is what appears to be a someone's room. **Notable characters:** This game didn't really have any. For some reason, Digimon comes to mind. **Notable gameplay mechanics:** None that I can recall. **Other details:** What I vaguely remember about this game is that the core focus seemed to be foot races on various tracks. The one track I can recall was what appeared to be someones room. All of the characters were tiny in comparison to the room (as in, the entire race could take place on the desk within the room). I'm sorry this is super vague, but it's about all I can remember about the game. I'm not even sure if the console is right, but I think it was PS1. It was definitely an older game.

I think that's the right term ***art style***: pixel art. the probe screen I think was limited in colour compared to some of the rest of the game? had music, seemed upbeat. ***notable characters***: some guy with voice acting [I think?] who was upset when the mission was failed; an alien...trader? I think? I remember them looking like the antedians from star trek, but I'm pretty sure that's my memory playing tricks on me. ***notable gameplay mechanics***: you could send a probe down to a planet and I think on a specific screen get data on the minerals. the probe could also be outfitted with different equipment for different purposes. I think the mission the voice-acted man was upset about was crashing a ship? I also remember the person who was playing the game saying that they thought [the voice-acted man] had done ""it"", which implies there was a mystery involved... I'm sorry there's not much to go on! I'm afraid I had a very limited exposure to it, for reasons I'll not bore you with. I've been looking for a really long time now and found nothing, so hopefully this will work also, it's not iron seed. the game I'm looking for is much more lighter and cartoonish.

It was science fiction, set in the world of Anne McCaffrey's Pern book series. I don't know when it was released, but I know for sure I saw it in the spring of 1990. The game was entirely text based. In it, you are the leader of a community in Pern. You have X amount of resources/services/unique objects to trade/gift/hoard as needed. There are like fifteen other communities; some you're buddies with, some you're at war with, some are neutral, you get the idea. Your goal is to offer services, negotiate trade deals, make alliances, etc with all these other communities, until you're the most powerful/influential leader in the world. There was no graphics. It was entirely text based. In fact, all you had was the 1980's version of an Excel file, black background, amber lettering, showing all the other groups, their constantly evolving opinions/relationships with you and each other (represented by percentages), and a scrolling Notes section at the bottom keeping you up to date on changing events (such as, ""Group X has declared war on Group Y, Group B has invited you to an important diplomatic function, a famine has struck in Group Z's territory,"" etc.) **Other details:**

8qvtei	game	extra	reddit	[PC][Unknown] Free Open-World RPG, choose and unlock character starts.. **Platform(s):** PC, you download the game from a website, entirely free. **Genre:** RPG. **Estimated year of release:** Not sure, but it should still be in active development. **Graphics/art style:** Drawn tile graphics, dark fantasy artstyle is how I would describe it. **Notable characters:** None that I can remember. **Notable gameplay mechanics:** It was semi-roguelike, you had one life and if you did certain things in the game you could unlock different character starts, like starting in some mage mountain hideout, or being a druid. **Other details:** The mages in-universe had screwed up big time and they ravaged the land, now mages are almost universally hated and hunted, only a few remain in hideouts, and that's about all I can remember.
8qw5a3	game	extra	reddit	[PC][?] A game where you control your little dude to escape/hide from bad people and puts you always thinking of finding new ways to pass levels.. PC Genre: Some suspense and has a background of a terror-like music, the style of how you control the dude is like Ori, but that's only the style not the gameplay it's way more calm and puts a person really thinking. Has some kind of black/white/grey effect all the time, like really dark colors. I think even the first level is to run from police and if you make any noise or so some police dogs come to bite you or you get shot by the police. Estimated year of release: I think I played in 2016 or 2017 Graphics/art style: Like I said above. Some kind of a window style like Ori but the gameplay is way different with lots of suspense and some kind of terror. Notable characters: Just one little dude Notable gameplay mechanics: Jumping, running, finding things, hiding. Other details: ... I'm sorry for my bad description of the game but it got so much of my attention that I forgot to ask the game's name when I played it and now I don't know how to find it.
8qweby	game	extra	reddit	[PC][2007-2011] Fantasy RPG Dragon Race. Platform(s): PC Genre: Fantasy RPG 3rd Person Adventure Estimated year of release: No later than 2011, probably after 2007 Graphics/art style: dark, all the female characters had your typical sexy armor Notable characters: First people in your party were the main character's sister and brother, their mentor was a dragon that was somehow related to them. The main character often heard a voice in his head from an evil ancestor named Malachi, I think, who would always tell the main character to do bad things. Notable gameplay mechanics: Click around to tell your party where to go/who to fight Other details: The race you played as was human mixed with dragonblood. The map was huge, it was a bunch of islands that could only be traveled between via ancient magical doorways. The dragon character at the beginning sent your party on a quest to get help from the light humans because your homeland was being attacked, but you had to go through several different races (dark elves, light elves, dwarves) because no one was willing to help. At one point in the game, you get your own small island to take care of and you have to set up it's defense. You started a city at the beginning of (almost) all the islands. You had workers who mined for stone, wood, and other natural resources. The city could create military units under your command, and as you became allies with more races, you could build their cities and get their types of military units. Thanks for your help.
8qwwrq	game	extra	reddit	[Mac][90s] Side scrolling, 2D, Space game.. It was 2d side scrolling. You controlled a spaceship with your mouse as you avoided obstacles and enemies as you flew left to right across the screen while shooting. One pickup I remember was a box with a cross in it. Once you picked it up you were invulnerable and the ship sort of breathed in and out as you were immune to damage. I seem to remember you had to land at the end of the level but that might be wrong. It was during the 90s. Thank you!
8qxjr2	game	extra	reddit	[PC] (Before 2008) Customizable Racing Game. Platform: PC Genre: Racing game Estimated Year of Release: It is at the very least older than 2008. I think it is from the late 1990s to early 2000s. But it definitely is older than 2008. Art Style: The game's art style doesn't really stand out. It most definitely is not cartoony or bright like Mario Kart is. It is not particularly dark though. The closest I'd say is maybe cyberpunk. Even though the race courses and cars weren't based on real things, the art style seemed realistic. The art was not pixel style like 8bit. Detail: A core mechanic of the game was unlocking parts to upgrade your car. I know you could upgrade the wings used to glide off of jumps and the tires. The wings started out like biplane wings. They had an old, canvas look. The best wings looked like steel/aluminum jet wings. I am pretty sure the wings only appeared when you pressed a button to use them. They were not just part of the car. The best tires had a large amount of long spikes on them. There were two ways to unlock new cars/parts. One was winning the race. The other was collecting colored boxes that gave you points. Different colored boxes were worth a different amount of points. If you had enough points at the end of the race, it would unlock something. Every course had a hidden area with golden boxes that gave enough points to unlock the item. I can remember a few of the courses. One was in a desert like area. It was marked with many large black tar pits. Another was in a jungle area. It had a volcano that you would race into. There was one city level where part of it races on a dock like area where construction was going on. It could have been an off shore oil well. I know the last course was in space. It was racing around in what I think was an asteroid beltwith lots of jumps. Notable characters: I don't think there were really any characters or plot for that matter.

8r2yi4	game	extra	reddit	IOS game really similar to splinter cell. So it was on all IOS devices, not really sure about android I played it on my iPod 4th generation on iOS 9/10 (not really sure) The genre was somewhat similar to splinter cell. Sort of like a sneak around game and try not to be seen. The year it came out was maybe 2006-2010 The graphics were somewhat similar to some 2d game (birds eye view) games. It was with darkish colors not bright colors such as red/pink although the lights were blue. Whoever you were trying to play as wanted to hide away from the guards/soldiers. They had the cone of vision that you had to hide from. If you were spotted it would turn yellow and it would send off alerts to every other guard and they would start to shoot at you, I'm pretty sure the starting character had a pistol. The main character looked really like snake but there was an unlock able character with white hair. I remember that their were more characters, but no idea what they looked like.

I'm still not sure if the game was ever finished. I don't think there was a skybox so the sky was probably black. There wasn't much of a grass texture other than just ""green"" to speak of. **Notable characters:**I think you might've been a knight in plate armour to start with.

8r67a8	game	extra	reddit	[PC][1995-1999]Fine Art Related Game. **Platform(s):** PC **Genre:** Possibly educational, Fine Art. Educational enough that we were allowed to play it at school as a reward for finishing our work. **Estimated year of release:** I played it during late elementary school (I'm 30), so it was probably released somewhere from 1996-1998 plus or minus a couple years on each side. **Graphics/art style:** What I remember the most is interacting with/recreating fine art. I specifically remember Van Gogh's Sunflowers and some other still life paintings. Possibly some Monet as well but I'm not 100&amp;#37; sure on that. It was trying to be realistic. I remember being impressed by the graphics of the mansion (could have been a museum or big house) setting. I feel like it was probably trying to be 3D because I remember wandering through the rooms of the mansion. **Notable characters:** I don't remember there being any other characters, but it's possible. I just remember the first person nature of it. **Notable gameplay mechanics:** I remember a lot of clicking and dragging type actions to interact with the paintings. Probably point and click as well to go from one room to another. I also remember wandering around a big house/mansion and going from room to room to play games/interact with paintings. I specifically remember placing apples and bananas in the right spots to recreate a still life painting. **Other details:** This was a game that a classmate brought to school (it was a Montessori school) in elementary school in the late 90's. She would have brought the game to school at some point during 1997-1999, but it could have been released earlier than that. I remember searching for the game in stores when I was in middle school and couldn't find it. I never asked my friend for the name of the game and unfortunately she passed away when I was in high school. I don't think it was specifically an educational game, but our teacher would let us play it during breaks or as a reward for finishing work. It was very popular and we would fight over who would get to play. The biggest parts of the game that I remember are going from room to room in the mansion/museum/big house and the paintings/fine art. I've looked through lots of lists and never been able to find it. I wish I could remember more about the game, but this is all I can recall.

8rb926	game	extra	reddit	[TOMT] [Video Game] Mid-2000s Single Player PC 1st/3rd person game. I feel like this is a really obvious one, but I can't remember the name. I used to play this at a friend's house. It was a single player game where you had a group of four characters (one woman, a white guy, a black guy and a robot) you could switch between at will for different tasks. I'm pretty sure they were all geared in futuristic white/silver uniforms/armour. The character I remember the most was the largest of the group, which was a buff humanoid robot. Another character could send out recon units like a drone or a mini tank and another one was more weapon/battle-oriented. When you died, you were sent to the last checkpoint via some sort of portal tunnel in 1st person. I'm pretty sure this was all set during an alien invasion inside of a ruined office building, though this may be just the portion I played. For the longest time I thought this was Half Life before making the obvious connection that Gordon wasn't one of the characters (I think).

I remember a decent amount of purple. The level required me to collect something, keys I think. I know the game was pretty hard, but was also like 5 or 6 so it could have been wet. It had a more cartoony feel than anything else. Could have been ps2 but I doubt it.
8rbwz1	game	extra	reddit	A point and click adventure Set in A dystpoian World.. Whilst my title does probably apply to a lot of games... i sure hope that my description of the game does not. Anyway here goes nothing! So to start with I briefly recall coming in contact with the game it must have been around 2015 or 2016 or maybe early 2017. As to when the game itself released, well I think it should have been around the same time I saw a video about it.(I m sorry that part is very vague) Now to the genre it was an indie point and click adventure I'm quite sure of that apart from that it was in 3D and 3rd person so no sidescroller game. It was kind of cinematic but not to an extended of something like until dawn, it was rather move your character from a to b solve puzzles find information and so on, no quick time events or anything like that. Finally the setting and plot: The game was as the title depicts set in a post apocalyptic world. You play two roles which you constantly switch throughout the game. You are either in the past or the present. In the past the people tried to safe themselves (from a nuclear holocaust I think) by hiding inside bunkers in cryostasis. In the present these people have resurfaced and build small settlements and the like. I'm not quite sure but I think you start in the past as one two engineers or I don't know as a facility management team which are inside of such a bunker where they are supposed to run some last checks to ensure the safety of the bunker and keep it secure so the people inside won't get hurt (or die or reawaken) until the earth is rehabitable I think. The latter one is set in a time where some people have resurfaced and build a settlement or something, they happen to stumble upon said bunker which has for some reason never opend neither do they get any life signs from it (clearly something must have gone wrong) and thus they send a team of two people inside to check out what happend or to scavenge it (I don't recall their intention could be a mixture of both for all I know). Anyway that's kind of the whole premise of the game you switch between those two party's and get to see the story of what happend within said bunker and why all the people inside are (dead?) gone. I hope that my rough information of the game or atleast the way I remember it helped to kind of sort it out and that you've actually read my post '^^ If anyone has any further questions on details that need to be explained feel free to ask I will ofcourse try to answer. Thanks for reading my question and every effort on finding said game. :D Have a nice weekend everyone.

8rfvfn	game	extra	reddit	[gameboy/gameboy color] An rpg game that is sorta like Pokémon.. So, this game is an old gb/gbc game, I think from the late 90s. As far as I can remember it’s fairly obscure, at least in the US. It’s an rpg that kinda reminds me of Pokémon, in the sense that you catch these wild “monsters” and train them to fight. The cartridge was black, and the cover art had a kid running forwards with a few of the monsters in the background. If I remember correctly, the character gets teleported to some weird land and has to fight and train these creatures to fight. I don’t remember anything else about the plot. As for the monsters, the only one I can remember is that it looked sort of like a Hershey kiss, but blue-ish and it had a face.

8rgki2	game	extra	reddit	Early-mid 2000s medieval browser game. This game was played entirely in a browser and took place in a universe similar to D&amp;D. It was free to play and you had turns to perform actions that would replenish over real time, usually like 30 minutes or an hour. Your character would level up and gain more turns to use per session and become more powerful. I seem to remember running into a lot of slime monsters, some of which could be pretty strong. The interface literally just looked like clipart and you would click one of the pictures to perform an action, one of which was tithing, which helped you somehow, but I’m not sure to what degree. I have pretty low hopes for a solution, but this has really bugged me the last few weeks and obviously googling “knight turn game” yields nothing close to the crappy old game I’m thinking of. Thanks ahead of time for the help!
8rgsw8	game	extra	reddit	[PS2?][2007?]Fantasy action-RPG I played once at a friend's house. **Platform(s):** One of the playstations, though I think PS2 **Genre:** Action RPG? Hack and slash? **Estimated year of release:** No idea **Graphics/art style:** Realistic fantasy **Notable characters:** Elf woman main quest-giver, one of the characters you could choose was a human barbarian who would go 'no more mana' in a funny voice whenever you pressed the magic button without mana **Notable gameplay mechanics:** Single player, fantasy game but it was real-time, combat hack and slash, you choose a character instead of creating one. You could switch between a top-down ish camera to a third-person close up view. **Other details:** The game started on these idyllic floating islands, and it was the 'hub world' where you had to go through a portal to get to the next level. Level 1 was strange purpleish caves while level 2 was this underground catacomb/sewer area. There were traps that could kill you in this game, the one that I remember distinctly is in the second level. If you took a side passage, you could find this conveyor belt leading to a machine like a furnace, with either a person or a person's skeleton strapped onto it (don't recall which). If you pulled the lever near the machine, the person/skeleton would be dragged into the machine and either ground up or cooked alive (again, don't remember which) and you would get a dialog message something like ""You've done something evil"" and would die if you tried doing it again. Sorry for the super-sparse and specific details, as the title says I've only played this game like once. It's stuck in my head ever since then, for whatever reason.
8rhq8f	game	extra	reddit	[TOMT] [Game] Mickey Mouse game in castle. Hello there! I recall playing a certain Mickey Mouse game when I was younger. I believe you played as wizard Mickey, and there were the Fantasia brooms carrying buckets of water as enemies. I recall the game being in a castle (a giant's castle?), and I think it was a side scroller. I remember a lot of water. I think you could enter a few rooms through doors on the background. It also may have been plug-n-play, but I'm really not sure about that. Any ideas what it may be? EDIT: I seem to recall a beanstalk in the game. The magic brooms with the water buckets were also invulnerable, and I recall their sprites having water splash out of the buckets. They didn't follow you, either, they went back and forth on a set path. I also have a feeling there was a red-headed giant in it, but I'm not too sure.

The only thing I could remeber from playing it was that you had a pet, either dog or cat, and you got a fishing rod early in the game. I thought it was either torchlight or fable but both of these games don't give you a fishing rod or pet.

8rkjxm	game	extra	reddit	[PC (DOS)][1997-ish] Futuristic racing game. Genre: Racing Estimated year of release: 1997 - or possibly slightly earlier. I played this game at Uni, sometimes multiplayer using a 20 foot long null modem cable. I left Uni in June 1997 so it has to be older than that. It was considered something of a spiritual successor to stunt car racer. There were a few cars on track (for some reason I think 16, but not sure!), unlike that title, but it had loops and corkscrews and other stunt elements to the tracks. There were cars with different stats, made by different manufacturers, but each manufacturer was connected to a country, so you were racing for Britain, USA, Japan, etc. They were cars though - not flyers or hovercars. The manufacturers were made up - but I seem to remember the name of the Japanese manufacturer being a bit of a portmanteau of genuine Japanese car manufacturer names. I think that's about all I can remember. Can anyone help? I've had no luck with google.

It was basicly this Pac man like game where you had to make these monsters chase you around a Pac man like map and when they went to this certain position you would have to ""kill"" it with this sweep looking thing. Then you had to color the whole map to move on to the next level.

The area around the building was probably desert too. I was a little kid when I was playing this game and english wasn't my native language so because of my lack of english most of time I was get stuck at start because you were supposed to talk to a npc and get a companion :D (Can be something else though).

I have no idea what it is called, but I know it probably was not too complicated to install since I know I managed to install it on my fathers computer when I got home from class. I think the protagonists were some kind of bug, or ant in keeping with the close to the ground, below the grass theme. I played it in Computer Lab in Elementary School but I do not remember there being any math involved, maybe it was a problem solving thing.**

The soundtrack was very unique, and the main character was called 'The Baller.' Your objective was to purge the game's world of the 'impure', I believe they called them. At one point there was a stage where you needed to traverse a set of canals flowing with meat, as well as a stage in a mine, and a stage in a library. There were companion fighters called 'Omegas' too, I believe. Close to the beginning of the game there was also a stage where you needed to judge which door to go through based on how loud the game's music was when you got close to them. Vague, I know, but any help is appreciated! I never finished the game, and really want to. Edit: I should also note that the game was top-down, with turn-based combat.
8rnngf	game	extra	reddit	An old flash-type game about the environment. I was gonna post this on HMF but I figured here would be better. It's not a traditional game, it was a game you accessed from a website I think, pretty sure it was PBS. It was about saving the environment, and you could create a character, where it can be made up of the body parts of different animals, you could name it and pick the ecosystem and food correlating to it. There were two games in the website that I remember. The first was set in a traditional house, where you have like an hour before the school bus comes, and you have to go through the main house, backyard, and garage and turn off lights and do other environmentally friendly things. The second was a kind of map of the world, and you can choose certain places and select tasks, where it gives you a prompt and you have to pick the friendliest one. Any attempts to find this would help, all searches have been fruitless
8ro9ms	game	extra	reddit	[TOMT] [CARD GAME] This is a shedding-type card game where each player gets 7 cards. Each player takes turns placing cards that beat the card the last player put down. If you can’t beat the card, you have to pick up the pile.. I don’t remember all of the rules perfectly, but I’ll do my best. Each player starts with 7 cards. There is a pile of cards facedown where you draw cards from (until it runs out). The first card from the deck is placed and the first player has to play a card that is either higher than that card or is a special (I believe specials are 2 and 10; i think 2 moves all of the cards into a separate discard pile and lets you play another card and 10 just lets you play any card, but that may be backwards). If you can’t beat the card or play a special, you have to pick up all of the cards from the pile (not the ones that have been discarded by the 2 card). Ace beats everything and you can play multiple cards of the same number at once. Thank you so much in advance!

From what I remember the characters aren't mecha, they are gundam style robots. there weren't any humans in the game (although I think I only played the demo). They reminded me of the silver surfer. Thanks.
8rr16e	game	extra	reddit	[PC] [Mid-2000's] Sci-fi space combat sim. **Platform(s):** PC **Genre:** Sci-fi space combat sim **Estimated year of release:** Early-mid 2000's **Graphics/art style:** 3D; generic sci-fi artstyle, possibly a bit industrial **Notable characters:** N/A **Notable gameplay mechanics:** Circular warp gates used to travel between ""worlds"" (planets, galaxies, no idea what it was). Both 3rd person and 1st person. **Other details:** Played it as a demo version, only 2 ships were available to use. Ship select screen was in a fully modelled hangar inside a space station. One of the ""worlds"" you could use a warp gate to travel to was called ""Europa"". One of the missions available involved destroying the turrets of a capital ship in an area filled with green gas/clouds with very low visibility. 1st person was in the form of a virtual HUD (I don't believe there were any fully modelled cockpits, but not 100&amp;#37; sure). That's about as much as I can remember. This might sound generic, but hopefully someone can figure it out. Cheers.
8rrjuv	game	extra	reddit	[Snes/PS1/N64][late 90s/early 00s] RPG game like Final Fantasy.. Platform(s): Don't remember but all I had growing up was SNES, PS1, N64. Genre: RPG like Final Fantasy Estimated year of release: I really don't know but I played it in the late 90s, early 2000's. Graphics/art style: I believe they used sprites for this game. Notable characters: First character in game was female. Other details: In the beginning of the game, you were a girl at some school and when you tried to leave through the front of the school, the person outside would say something like ""you can't go home, it's about to rain!"" I believe that person was a nun? After that it's a little hazy... I remember finding a secret room in that school where you would find some type of power then the game would change to another character in some town... not sure. My brother remembers playing this game too but we don't know what it's called.

You could wallrun, slide, walljump, climb up ledges and that was it **Other details:** \- Levels were just structures made from the same types of cubes. It was also just basic level design without many decorations. \- Didn't get far, but I remember later on there was some generic darkness or something consuming the platforms, so you had to run away quickly. \- First saw it when youtubers play it. Mainly Jacksepticeye.

The thing I remember was a grid based tactic combat, probably turn-based. It was top down and set on conquering the America (indians and english era). I remember the grid being only part of the game and not very large perhaps 6x6 or close to it. You would get in to the grid when a fight started. There were canons in the grids. And you fought indians.

The combat system *aesthetic* is kinda like Earthbound where the Enemy is huge and at the top of the screen and you're below them and your party is shown with small character icons.

I don’t remember getting it because I just remember being there. I think my dad might’ve burned it onto a blank disc because it didn’t have a logo or anything. It looked like a typical CD that you would buy at the store. It’s cover was green though. It had all the characters from Winnie the Pooh. There were activities that you could complete like looking for Eeyore’s tail. The one that my sister and I enjoyed the most was the one where you could bake with Rabbit. I’m not totally sure if you could be creative and do whatever you wanted or if there were recipes that you had to follow. Thanks in advance!

8s3ai4	game	extra	reddit	[PC][2000-2007] WWII-era first person shooter, potentially a demo for a full game.. To be honest, I really don't remember much. This is a game I played when I was very young, around 6-7, but not knowing what it is has been nagging me for years now. I spoke to my brother about this a few months ago, he mentioned that he couldn't remember either, but that it might have been a demo of a full game, of which we only owned the demo. **Platform(s):** Windows, at least XP from what I can remember. **Genre:** Gritty, realistic first-person shooter set in WW2-era. **Estimated year of release:** Early-Mid 2000s (2000-2007, most likely) **Graphics/art style:** Dark, gritty, realistic (for the time), fully 3D. No weather system, if I recall, but I remember the skybox being particularly overcast. Lots of ruined buildings, rubble you can walk over, etc. **Notable characters:** I don't really remember the hard details, I do recall some other AI teammates, when I played it, never lasted long. All soldiers, there's only one section that has a functioning (yet non-moving, from my memory) tank that fires upon your squad. Other than that, it's all soldiers. **Notable gameplay mechanics:** There might've been some AI companions you could fight with, but I mostly remember braving it all alone, either due to my sheer incompetence or scripted deaths, I'm not sure. I don't remember the mission objectives, there's a few sections that are clear, but for the most part I don't remember the actual objectives, other than kill everyone and survive. **Other details:** There's a section where you fight a tank with limited RPG ammo, that you pick up from a destroyed truck. Facing the tank, there's a field to the right, and a section of destroyed buildings to the left you can hide in. There's some commentary on the tank from ai members, but they quickly die if you don't take it out. I don't remember the tank moving, I just remember blowing up a lot if you stayed in its view for too long. Later on there's a section in a field with a destroyed church in the center. Mines surround the church, and there's a lot of craters around the church from artillery/mine explosions. The church has a sniper in it somewhere that takes shots at you, and you have to move from crater to crater using them as cover. As a completely unnecessary sidenote, I remember printing out a screenshot of the game in full colour, depicting the entrance to a ruined building over some rubble. I have since lost it, but I remember my parents being quite angry with me for printing out a useless full-colour screenshot. Thank you for any help, sorry for not providing a ton of details, my memory is quite fuzzy, but this has been on my mind for quite some time now, and I could not for the life of me figure it out without buying every WW2-era videogame from the early 90s, thought I might as well try [r/tipofmyjoystick](https://www.reddit.com/r/tipofmyjoystick).
8s4lbs	game	extra	reddit	[PC] Dig Dug kind of jewel collecting game. I’ve been having the urge to play this certain game from when I was kid and just starting to get into video games. You play as this blue dragon that basically tunnels down into layers of dirt, like in Dig Dug, and collects all of these blue gems scattered throughout in order to advance to the next level. There were also all sorts of baddies trying to make their own way towards you in order to end your adventure. I don’t remember much else besides that, although I’m assuming it was made in the late 90’s, early 2000’s. Fun sort of puzzle game with MANY levels and progressing difficulty that kept me on my toes (maybe it’s a breeze now that I’m an adult lol). I’d be surprised if anyone else actually played this game, because all I can find on Google are Bejeweled clones featuring dragons :P

8s4x78	game	extra	reddit	[PC]Early 2000s? - 3D first-person investigative gothic horror set in a creepy town with weird not-quite-human NPCs, I heard it was getting a remake/may have already?. Sorry, really scarce memory of this one. It's a first-person game in a grimy, Victorian-esque town with some really bizarre characters. Main character is male, and possibly a doctor? At the start of the game he wakes up in somebody's house, and from there I think you go around trying to solve some kind of plague that's going around. It may have had a bad English translation, and possibly also bad voice-acting, but not sure about that. I think it's also one of those games where the NPCs go about their lives according to a schedule, and events will transpire in the background if you take too long. In the last few years, I'd heard it was getting a remake, but that's all I know about that.

8s7mam	game	extra	reddit	[PC][2001-2002?]Top-down view game(rpg?) with stealth elements. I want to find an old windows game I played a bit in childhood. I think game was released somewhere between 1999-2002. It was with top down view. I think camera was rotatable and graphic was 3D. You start playing as a guy on a big indoors map. I think it was some sort of prison, that you should escape from. Most of people on the map are hostile, and if they see you they will set alarm and you'd be killed pretty fast. So most of the time(on that level at least) you are trying to be stealthy. For that there is view where you could see sight cones of NPCs. But there was also friendly characters that you can speak and they give you quests. One of the first tasks was to get to this kind of NPC who, as far as I can remeber, working out in a gym on that map. Then there was task to steal some papers from office on that same map. I haven't got past that first map, and I don't really remeber much, so take this with a grain of salt. Techology level in the game I think on XX centrury level, although not sure. Also there definitely was journal with main and side quests, and possibly item inventory and mini-map.
8s7ptu	game	extra	reddit	Old free roam racing game on pc in early 2000s. I remember my dad used to play a load of racing games on his pc when I was younger and I remember playing and enjoying one way more than the rest but I could never find it in the collection or remember the name. The details are as follows: Platform: PC, although it could have been on console potentially Genre: Racing, however it focused on free roam and mission style gameplay Year of release: Should be within 2000-2004 as that’s when I mainly played those games Graphics: While I don’t think they have aged well now, it was going for a realistic look at the time. The game had a city map that I would describe as an American bay town. Maybe like New York? Notable characters: While there were only cars, one of the main cars looked similar to a mustang and I believe that was the default car. I think there might have also been an opening cutscene with some generic action movie people as well but I can’t be certain on that detail Notable gameplay mechanics: One part of the game that I remember was the jumping, which had proper ramps and the such. There may have been a chase mechanic to it and some destructible environments Other details: I remember the area where you first spawn into the level. You start right by the coast, with a large building on your right. Behind you is a long bridge that takes you to another part of the city. Drive past the building on your right and you see the ocean where jumps for missions were usually set up. If you went left you’d go into the city. I also always remember the death sound, if you landed in water it had this short snappy death jingle sound but that’s hard to describe. Any guesses will be appreciated as I would love to play this game again.

8s8jw5	game	extra	reddit	[TOMT] A flash game from the early 2000's where you program a guys moves.. I remember the main color scheme was gray.

The object was to get to a specific tile/platform in the maze. You had to avoid specific tiles, and jump up to other tiles to get to the goal. I think i remember him shuffling around lazily, like it took him too long to execute each move. It may have been on newgrounds or one of the other free flash game sites from around that time. Maybe addictinggames.com, or something like freearcadegames comes to mind too. Edit: I should add the perspective was like a side high up angle. Not quite 3rd person, but maybe at a 35-45 degree up from ground

I can't remember for sure, but I think your character was in a wheelchair and i THINK you could see like a broken leg on screen as part of your FPS vision character? You where roaming around (what It think was) a sunny hospital. I think the premise was that your parents got you clowns to cheer you up, and you had to get away from the clowns. It could very well have been an old shareware game that was local to me. But I remember it ran on my old windows 95 machine. Graphics were super cheap. Everything was a sprite with like 3 keyframe animations. Any ideas?
8s9z5z	game	extra	reddit	[PS2 I think][Early 2000s] GTA Clone/Knockoff with replay mechanic. **Platform(s):** I'm pretty sure this was on the PS2. Could be early PS3 or the Xbox 360 though. **Genre:** It was like a free-roam game where you drive cars? Like GTA but I'm not sure if there were other people you could beat up like in that game. **Estimated year of release:** Early 2000s-ish **Graphics/art style:** Meant to look realistic, but probably looks bad now. Mid PS2 era so it kind of looked like GTA 3? But it was more summery and well lit. It might have been on Xbox 360 or early PS3 as well/instead. **Notable characters:** I don't remember any characters but I think the main character was the only person? I could be wrong though. **Notable gameplay mechanics:** The one thing I remember about this game that set it apart from other GTA clones was the replay mechanic. If you did something in this game I remember you could rewind the tape and watch it back as well as fast forwarding/rewinding and controlling where the camera was. I think you were only allowed to do this when you died. I'm pretty sure it wasn't Skate 3 because I remember driving in a car? But I might be wrong. **Other details:** I only played this game for like 30 seconds. I was at some guy's house and we were playing it in his room, which is why I don't remember much. I think I was using a PlayStation controller and I remember the game was sort of set in summer. I remember I died and we replayed the video and I was having a tonne of fun just doing that over and over again.
8s30lj	game	extra	reddit	[PC?][1990s, possibly earlier] Looking for an old point-and-click(?) adventure game. According to my roommate there was a really old adventure game (most likely point-and-click) which has a young blond boy with pajamas and a blanket which he uses to teleport a made-up fantasy world where the furniture can talk, and at some point you get into an elevator bucket. The game is probably aimed at children and my roommate thinks it has something along the lines of ""The Adventures of..."" in the name, but isn't sure. I apologise if this is too vague a description or if it turns out to be a wild goose chase because the roommate misremembered something.
8s36bk	game	extra	reddit	[PS2]Top down cartoony shooting game where you play as an Ice Princess. It's for PS2, hard to the point where it's unfair and IMO not much fun to play.

The box art had a bunch of silly looking demons on it, almost like something out of Monsters Inc.

8s64hf	game	extra	reddit	Dog game with joystick. Platform: No clue, all I remember was a joystick plugged into something. Genre:, Most likely adventure and something to do with pets Estimated year of release: Anywhere between 2002-2007 Graphics/Art Style: Very basic, colours washed out, I sort of remember it being very brown, like everything was brown with darker brown spots to show colour change. Notable characters: You played a dog Notable gameplay mechanics: You ran around digging stuff up, feeding your dog, looking for stuff, etc. The screen would move side to side as you moved, so it was sort of like top down, but angled. Other details: Nothing much else, I honestly have doubts this game even existed and I'm somehow imagining this, because I cannot find it anywhere, but I swear this existed. Thank you to everyone helping!
8s67sa	game	extra	reddit	[TOMT] [POST] Pirates of the Caribbean game I used to play when I was a kid. Hello r/tipofmytongue, I am looking for a game I used to play when I was a little old. I remember some of the key things you have to do in-game; 1. Build a ship fleet of your own and sail the ocean, 2. Face rivals (mainly it was like a blacklist and I remember the 2nd Boss was Blackbeard and the 1st one was a Morgan) 3. Treasure hunt, you can find maps of some sort and goto islands in search of thaf treasure, 4. Escape or fight random pirates on the ocean (you would encounter bosses randomly on the ocean as well) 5. The speed is dependant on your fleet, if it is huge, the speed will be slow and vice versa. Speed is important because when you encounter a rival you know you can’t defeat, you’ll have to flee. 6. You can also get captured and escape. My memory is a little blurry here but basically you’ll have to sneak around the island and get to the beach where your ship will await you along with your crew. 7. You can combat long range or you can board a ship and fight with swords using NUM keys. Those are the highlights I remember, I am unable to find the name of this game or even a link to download. Any help finding it would be appreciated and would certainly make my day! Thanks!

8s76i6	game	extra	reddit	[PC][2000s] RPG game. **Platform(s):** PC **Genre:** RPG/Adventure It was a 3D RPG 3rd person video game, you started out as a warrior fighting off waves of enemies in a forest battlefield, I remember the music very vividly. They looked like a mix of orcs and goblins, their ears were pointed and their skin was pale. (I don't know the terminology) I remember you could trigger catapults and at the end of the first area you rescued some villagers trapped in a cage, for some odd reason i remember breaking a lot of barrels. Later on the warrior spots a female elf rogue in a cage, she escapes by slitting one enemies throat and grabbing the cell key, she later on joins the party and could go invisible in the shadows. I remember the warrior and rogue sharing witty remarks, later on a mage also joins your party. You could switch from all 3 characters whenever you wanted, there was a level up system as far as i remember. Any ideas?
8s82fy	game	extra	reddit	[TOMT] [90s computer game]. It's a computer game I used to play in the mid 90s (between 94 and 97), but could have come out earlier. I don't remember much, but I remember the setting being a green scenery, seen from above somewhat (maybe not all the time throughout the game but at least at some point). I'm sure there were palm trees, there was something about growing palm trees. I don't remember there being any (people) characters in this game. I don't remember the objective either but sometimes a sort of twister/tornado would come around and annihilate everything. My dad says the game's name is 'Island' or something like that, but I haven't found anything that compares to my memories with that name on the net. Any help would be appreciated, it's been driving me crazy for a couple years now!
8s256f	game	extra	reddit	Puzzle game from mid 90's on PC/MS-DOS. **Platform(s):** MS-DOS (possibly Windows I encountered it on a shareware disk) **Genre:** Puzzle / turn based strategy **Estimated year of release:** some time in the early to mid 90's **Graphics/art style:** 2D ""map overview"" consisting of octagons, an ocean and islands **Notable characters:** battleships, destroyers, various war ships **Notable gameplay mechanics:** You started with (5 I think ) warships docked on the far left of the map. The goal was that each turn you could move *or* scan *or* drop a depth charge/torpedo and the goal was to find and destroy the PC's subs. If you selected ""scan"" and there was a sub within the range of the vessel (each vessel had a different range) then the map, which was sectioned out into octagons, would draw a large white octagon centered around the ship and one of those white octagons contained a sub. The key or trick was to find a sub with one ship then ""triangulate"" or ""octalocate"" the sub by identifying where the two white octagons intersected...which would be the location of the enemy sub. **Other details:** The game was encountered on a shareware disk in the mid 90's. The shareware version included 1 map only and you could buy the game to get all the other maps. It ran in MS-DOS but I remember launching it from a Windows 95/98 PC. I do not believe it was made by Apogee software, which was a big player in the market back then. Reminds me of an ""upgraded"" version of battleship except instead of 2 directions (up/down) it is 8 due to the octagonal nature of the play field.

8sa4la	game	extra	reddit	[Mac][2005]3D simple graphics;fly til you find level up object. Mac : (only?) Genre: puzzle; free 2005 was when I found it Graphics/art style: color vector graphics similar to Atari Asteroid/Tempest Notable characters: None Notable gameplay mechanics: Simple flying game with 'thermals' Other details: mouse and arrow buttons. You are presented with a 3D black world on a grid with towers of colorful objects. On top of one of them is an object that, when touched, starts a more complex level. There's ambient music. You can just fly around, which is fun and relaxing, but eventually, the level up object is really hard to find. You fall unless you are in a column, which gives you lift.

8sb1yb	game	extra	reddit	[TOMT] [GAME] Sci-Fi Third Person Shooter from 2000-2006 where Humans have developed on multiple planets and an alien empire is hunting them down.. Hi there, I'm trying to remember a PC game I ended up playing as a young teenager. I'd estimate it was released anytime between 2000 and 2006 based on how I remember it looking. I'll try to list absolutely everything I can remember about this game. It was a sci-fi third person shooter. I have a feeling it was taking some heavy Halo influences. The basic premise seemed to be that Humans could develop on multiple worlds. You were a Human on some world that wasn't Earth. Very early on a militaristic alien empire invades your world. You find out that Humans are somehow special and that this empire is hunting them down as soon as they find a planet where Humans have developed. Somehow during this attack you gain powers of some sort due to Humans being this special messiah-like race. You could use these abilities in conjunction with regular weaponry to defeat your enemies. At some point I think your planet is destroyed or at least invaded by this alien empire. They had either four arms or four legs and two arms, but I'm positive they had a total of 6 limbs. IIRC their colour-scheme was red and black. However you are saved during the invasion by another group of aliens who are wary of the harm it could bring them, but do know Humans are this special thing. They had very a purple / greyish motif and their ships were, IIRC, very biological or ""space elf"" looking. It's these aliens which explain the plot to you. The cover was very yellow with some slight green and orange influences to it. I believe it had your main character floating with his arms extended behind the title font but I can't be sure of that. I have a suspicion the title was some sort of single term like ""Revelation"" or something equally as ambiguous. I have a feeling the game either wasn't very good or just extremely unknown since I don't remember ever hearing about it outside of me owning a copy of it. And even then I think I scored that copy for a couple bucks at a second-hand store. I'll happy try to answer any extra questions you might have about it that might help us narrow it down. Thanks in advance.

8sg1xv	game	extra	reddit	Such a long shot but..... This has alluded me for years! Okay so this game I feel might not even exist or that I saw it in a dream because for years I can never find it or remember the name. Description: I remember it was multiplayer because both me and my sister would play it. It was really old, I don’t think it was on nintendo64 because I feel like I would have found it by now, but I feel it’s from that time period..... possibly ps1, sega Saturn/ sega genesis? We were characters that walked around the map and had powers... the significant power I remember was that a character would make boulders or meteors fall from the sky to hurt the enemies The other thing I remember was that we would collect something while walking around... I don’t remember if it was coins or what but for some reason I feel like they spun and maybe were purple.... Last big thing I remember from this game is that when you got a certain amount of the “coins?” It would take us to another area or level or something..... I know these are horrible descriptions but it drives me crazy because I feel like it’s a real game but can never find it. Most likely it might have been an 8 bit or 16 bit game that is not popular... maybe it was based on gods or wizards?? I don’t remember :/

8shkfh	game	extra	reddit	[TOMT][video game] Arena shooter with water guns. I remember playing some kind of Arena shooter as a child, but it had water guns instead of real guns. IIRC it was somewhat like Quake mechanics-wise. It might have been ""Super Soaker"" licensed, but I'm not 100% sure about that. This was in the mid-to late 2000's. I searched for it on Google and reddit already, but couldn't find anything remotely similar. Edit: Forgot to add that the game was on PC

8si7pn	game	extra	reddit	Looking for a weird 2D platformer from the 90's Player character had a stretchy neck. **Platform(s): PC**(or at least I played it on PC) **Genre:** 2D platformer **Estimated year of release:** 1990's **Graphics/art style:** Cartoony, I think something candy related might have been there, not sure **Notable characters:** Weird orange tinted creature was the main character. There was a mechanic where the player character could elongate their neck upwards **Notable gameplay mechanics:** The levels were huge **Other details:** Ok so I remember playing this weird 2D platformer back in the day. The details are up there. I also remember that it was possible to get a drivable car in some levels. The most important thing was the neck tho. You could just press (I think it was the Space bar) a button and the playable character would elongate their neck for some effect. I can't remember anything about the story. The game was weird as hell tho.
8sinup	game	extra	reddit	Looking for an old RTS game.. The object of the game was to destroy your enemies cities and you would do this by building up you economy and sending troops to their cities. It has a strong AI opponent as well. You could progress from the Stone Age to what the game called ""the gun powder age"" and eventually nukes. The game had a 7 or 14 nuke limit and you could not play after that many nukes. The map was also very detailed showing what cities you captured with their city names as well as troop locations. I think it was available through windows store but I am not sure. The details could be a bit off due to how long it had been since I've seen this game. Thank you.

8skzsz	game	extra	reddit	Looking for an old game. It was a PC game, I believe it was 3rd person and it was set on another planet , with aliens on it and it was a shooter. The character you played had powers that you could get and upgrade throughout the story line. I really don't remember much it was a really long time ago, but I do remember a very specific ability the character had. It was a pink shield of some sort that you could place in front of you and block enemy attacks, it was shaped like a door and with enough upgrades you could place multiple shields. Also in the end, the character wakes up on another planet, a really cold one and could barely walk. The final scene was the player falling down on the snowy ground, out of energy and an alien picking him up and using something to warm him up. I remember once I searched if the game had a second part and at the time i remembered the name but now it's blank. That's all I could remember, any help is appreciated.

8sls8i	game	extra	reddit	Help me find an old fighting game. At the very start you get to choose whether you are going to play it singleplayer or 2 players. You could choose either a black or a white character, but they were the same in regards to abilities. The very first mission starts off in a bank that has been robbed. The game is 2d but you can also move up and down, so it gives you a 3d effect. There are many bosses in the game. The first one I remember is a buff guy that has wheels instead of legs and does charge attacks. You can pick up items and find food that heals you. I also remember a mission where you're on a train. There is a barrel shooting mini game in the game that's just for fun, probably for the 2 players to compare, but you can also play it if you're alone. You fight the last boss in a skyscraper, in his office. You enter the skyscraper by crashing in it with an exo suit, I think. The game has many missions. One of them is played in the sewers. I remember robots that had these annoying arms that could extend really far. if I remember anything else I'll add it.

8snkz2	game	extra	reddit	PC, Maybe 2003-2006, Game about a crew on a spaceship and one of them is a traitor (maybe formerly called Sonder?). Probably exclusively PC RPG/life sim Probably 2003-2006 judging by the graphics but maybe newer, maybe even 2013+ Old school 3D comparable to Deus Ex Invisible War. first person perspective that I believe changed to third person during dialog One of the characters (I think this was chosen at random while loading) is a traitor that planted a bomb somewhere on the spaceship The game is presented as a sci-fi themed Whodunit. You have to interview basically everybody on board through fairly sophisticated branching dialog trees in order to figure out who you think is the traitor, from what I can remember the game's main selling point was that the traitor was different every time (COULD BE WRONG ABOUT THAT). I never completed it, but from my experience, the entirety of the game seems to take place on the same level and 99% of the gameplay was through dialog trees though you were free to explore almost all of the ship and unlocked doors by getting hints or items from the other NPC's. I remember you could inspect all of the crews rooms and the ship had multiple levels, accessed with stairs from the cargo bay in the rear of the ship or a ladder at the middle and front of the ship. The ship itself was brightly colored, lots of metal greys with yellow pipes and handrails running through the ship. Almost every computer screen (intractable or otherwise) was bright light blue like every computer screen from that era of graphics. [I keep thinking the game is called Sonder, but the only thing I can find with that name is an episodic early access title on Steam](https://store.steampowered.com/app/397850/Sonder_Episode_ONE/) that isn't it.

8su3ds	game	extra	reddit	Horror game where serial killer recreates famous paintings with corpses.. Platform: PC Genre: Horror Year: 2010's? No Earlier than 2000's Graphics: Realistic, 3D rendered, dark, dirty. Third person fixed camera/ side on? Maybe 1st person or some portions may zoom to first to show certain elements (art/ the weapon you are building). Characters: You play as an adult (20-40 yo) woman who is captured by a serial killer. He is possibly a doctor of some kind and may wear a surgical mask. I only remember those two characters being present in the game and for some reason I can't seem to picture either of them. Setting: Present day, serial killer's murder basement. The map consists of several rooms. Some of them include a cooler-like room where you wake up, a room or rooms full of human dioramas, a tool room/ workshop and the man's kill room where he works on corpses. Possibly with a dentist's style chair under a bright light in the center. I think the exit is on the far side of this room. Gameplay: You wake up in a serial killer's basement. You discover that he is posing his victim's bodies to recreate famous paintings. For some reason you have to find the missing element to some of these dioramas to finish the picture. For example: adding an earring to *Girl with a Pearl Earring*. You must sneak around through several connected rooms without attracting the killer's attention, completing puzzles and building a weapon. I believe there were multiple variations of the weapon you could build. One was a circular sawblade on a stick or pipe. The killer spends most of his time in his kill room. I think you have to fight your way past him to escape. Other: I believe I watched a YouTuber play this but I can't remember which one and my husband has no memory of it. For some reason I'm getting the memory confused with The Cat Lady, and the Heavy Rain DLC, so It's especially hard to pick apart. It did seem very much like a segment from Cat Lady and possibly a similar length but I believe the art was 3D rendered. I've tried every Google keyword search I can think of and haven't found it.

I've already found Lucky Luke ([https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=poKSW62tke8](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=poKSW62tke8)) from 1997, I suppose the others might be from this time, too. There was one with aliens - it was pretty creepy for me, there were different creatures around the map, you could move up and down on ladders, there were also different rooms - somehow it reminds me of the movie called ""Antz"". There was a character - maybe yours actually - which said something like ""Zoe"" in a strange alien voice. The other one is more of a cartoon. You started at the bottom of a ship and had to fight your way up to the top - through the kitchen, vents, deck, library(?), other rooms, etc - where you met various enemies which you could hit with a bat. There were moving obstacles too. Feel free to ask for more info, I might remember some other significant details. Also I'm pretty new to Reddit, so please forgive me if I've made any mistakes :D
