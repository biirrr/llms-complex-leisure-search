You are some sort of cop in a town with a mutant outbreak happening, and you slowly become more and more powerful as the game progresses. I believe there are missions where you find like a hole in the ground and mutants are pouring out that you need to close. I also think I remember a cutscene with a reporter talking about the outbreak and then being killed by a mutant. Thanks for the help.

I think you might see your girlfriend being snatched by some monster and the goal is to save her. **Notable gameplay mechanics:** You could freely move around backwards, forwards, left and right. You can see the protagonist (it isn't first person, your character has a sprite). I don't think there was any jumping.

IBM? I played it in a computer lab around 1990 or so using 5.25 floppy disks** **Genre: Adventure \(magic?\)** **Estimated year of release: Around 1985** **Graphics/art style: Black background. Brown platforms. Simplistic line drawn characters \(stick figure\-ish\)** **Notable characters: You play a wizard\(?\); lots of various creatures** **Notable gameplay mechanics: You wander around a set map filled with creatures. You gather spells\(?\) needed to kill said creatures. It is platform style but open in that you can explore different areas by running and jumping around.** **Other details: \(SEE BELOW\)** \(I copied this from a different thread at the suggestion of a friend\) I've literally been hunting the name of this game down for decades. Here's the story. Back around 1990 or so, I was in the 7th grade in Oregon. After we ate lunch but before the bell rang \(i.e. lunch recess\), we could go play games at the computer lab. The games ran off the old 5.25 floppy disks \(the thin black ones\), so I guess they were DOS games. They were mostly learning games, but they had some off the wall ones too. One was a text\-based adventure based on Star Wars where you had to swing across a chasm and rescue the princess while avoiding the Wookiee \(I guess Wookiees were bad in this game\). Anyway, about the game I've been trying to find.... I don't remember very much about it except it involved some sort of a wizard. The layout of the world was vaguely similar to Nintendo's ""Legacy of the Wizard"" in that you wandered around an open underground world with a black background killing monsters \(which were everywhere\). In order to kill the monsters, you had to collect spells \(which I believe were laying around in random locations\). The spells were specific to the monsters, so if you didn't have it, you couldn't beat that monster. I vaguely recall the spells being actual letters/words on the screen that you picked up by walking into them. This was by far the most popular game among my friends, and we would actually draw out maps showing where the various spells were located. I'd very much like to know the title of this game so I can share it with my son. So, if this rings a bell please let me know. Or if you want to pick my brain for more information, fire away. Thanks in advance! \(UPDATE: Another user asked if it was Rogue/Hack/Nethack. I don't think it was either of those, although it does vaguely resemble Rogue in that it had the same brown color throughout it. This game was more of a platform game with jumping. As a disclaimer, I may be remembering some of this incorrectly as it's been nearly 30 years since I played it.\)",2,,,,

You'll get murdered too and continue playing as the villain who's apparently a very powerful guy. You teleport and end up in a dungeon. Eventually you meet up with a woman \(I remember her as a goddes of some kind, or a powerful beeing\). The protagonist and the goddes get in to a disput and she removes all of your powers.

202,8nvh00,tipofmyjoystick,[PC] [2005-2014] Text Based Escape Game With A Psychologically Manipulative AI Captor,3,8nvh00,1,2018-06-01 23:06:18,JFilli,"Platform(s): This was a free, online game, on the website Kongregate. Genre: It was a text based, psychological horror, escape game. Estimated year of release: It came out before the year 2014, when I played it, and it had a modern enough concept to come out after 2005. I assume the second part, since I cannot give a definitive date. Graphics/art style: There were no pictures, since it was a text based game. But it was white text on a black background. Notable characters: The person you play in the game is supposed to be the actual you. There is also an AI, who hates they player, that's your captor. Notable gameplay mechanics: There were parts of the game where the player would type commands. Things like, ""look at box,"" or ""examine room,"" but if the player typed a command that wouldn't work, the AI would belittle them. There are different puzzles in the game, but the player had to always type the answer. [One of the the puzzles is guessing a number from 0 to 1,000 or 1,000,000. The player guess the number, and the AI tells the play to guess higher or lower. Each time the player get it wrong, the robot demeans them more.](#spoiler) Other details: The game is very depressing and nihilistic. During some part of the game, the AI says something like, [""You could be creative and write a book. Just like every other human in the world.""](#spoiler) The AI talks extensively about how the player is wasting time and is going to die. The goal is to escape the game, even with the AI constantly insulting the player. I remember I saw it on a blog called sixpenceee on Tumblr, but I cannot find the link anymore.",1,,,,

The game follows a kid through school, and it has a subplot of a kid getting kidnapped if I remember correctly. It was educational and had a ""don't talk to strangers"" message.

They had to play against each other and, clearly, most of those who had been given more money in the beginning of the game were winning due to their financial advantages... BUT they did not attribute their winnings to that—they all basically said they were doing so well because they were working harder and smarter, and that those who were losing/with less money just needed to work harder in order to win, demonstrating the mindset change that people get when they have money (or make a lot of money) towards those who don’t have the same advantages and explaining why the “work harder and you can be successful” sentiment is so common but not usually accurate/attainable.

It was basically like any football game but with a Doom (2015) look. The minor details are that the teams only had 4 players and the ball was a flaming human skull. I don't remember much about it. The game might have been called ""Revenge"" or some other edgy thing, but no results cameup when I looked for it that way. **Platform(s):** PSX **Genre:** Sports (technically I guess) **Estimated year of release:** 2000s **Graphics/art style:** Third Person Top-Down 3D Perspective **Notable characters:** I have no idea if they were the protagonists, but the team I used to play as were called The Bombers, the were robots with yellow caps. There was a team of mutant dragon dudes and also, some buffed green dudes that kinda looked like Doomguy on steroids. **Notable gameplay mechanics:** There were this light pillars in the field that triggered an ice/fire effect that affected all players on-screen if the skull/ball got to hit them. **Other details:** The aesthethic of the game was really over the top. It wasn't a gory game but the maps were all fire and shit. The soundtrack was also really power metal-ish.",2,,,,

481,8o5nlv,tipofmyjoystick,[Blackberry 6210][2003]Searching for an obscure multiplayer game on one of the older Blackberry phones.,3,8o5nlv,1,2018-06-03 04:43:20,Glassfoot,"**Platform(s):** Blackberry 6210 (as well as other models) **Genre:** RPG, Multiplayer (or MMO maybe) **Estimated year of release:** 2003-2004 **Graphics/art style:** The art style had a very simple retro-fantasy look to it with an overhead view of your tiny character centered in the screen. On the particular Blackberry model that I used everything was in black and white, but I met other players in the game that had a colored version. **Notable characters:** Mainly other players and certain types of enemies. As it was a more medieval fantasy type game most of the enemies included goblins and trolls and among other simple fantasy monsters and enemies. **Notable gameplay mechanics:** The game was similar to other dungeon crawlers and roguelikes. You made simple movements one step at a time and attacked one step at a time. It was somewhat turnbased from what I remember. You could also battle other players, trade with them, and communicate with them. You could join guilds or clans and group up. It was very typical for an mmo-type game, but available for people that had certain blackberry phones. **Other details:** I've searched everywhere, this was sorta an obscure gem of mine that I've been unable to find for a long time. I was fairly young and don't remember too much of it as it's been more than a decade since I've played it. I'm fairly sure it was on the Blackberry 6210 model that I found online but I can't find much information on the software contained on the phone including the games that came with it.

It was virus-free and pretty clean so I think it might have been someone's very obscure indie game. **Genre:** 2D sidescroller/platformer, I don't remember platforming being a huge aspect of the game. **Estimated year of release:** Unknown. I think I got it anywhere between 2008-2012. I used to browse for free games on Jayisgames a lot but it doesn't seem to be there when I search 'dinosaur'. **Graphics/art style:** 'Pixel' graphics? The dinosaur was very 'flat', and animated like a puppet rig would be in Flash, so no frame-by-frame animations, like a paper doll with limbs that moved on pivots. The game had no anti-aliasing so everything would have jagged edges, which is why it looked pixelly. The art style wasn't cutesy or pop, everything was quite desaturated which gave the game a dull atmosphere. Enemies would turn into bloody chunks when you ate them. **Notable characters:** The dinosaur, which would 'grow' as you went through the game and evolved different traits. I remember playing through once and it became red-scaled with a smooth T-rex like head, then in another, it evolved into blue scales with spikes everywhere. You could become faster, or have a higher defence but I'm not sure if this was determined by how you played or if you distributed points. There were no NPCs to talk to, just the dinosaur and the enemies. **Notable gameplay mechanics:** See above ^. The gameplay revolved around you, the dinosaur, breaking out of a facility and eating any human that stops you. The enemies had guns and increased in frequency and toughness every level. I don't remember the combat ever being more complex than pressing a button to bite and watch them explode into gore, and that was all I did - run through the levels and try not to die by eating them faster than they can shoot me down. **Other details:** The atmosphere was a tiny bit eerie, from the art style, the gore and the fact that there was no music (not sure on this, I might have played it on mute). I highly, highly doubt this was by a company or big developer, this was one of many downloads I got through searching things like 'free action games' as a bored kid.",1,,,,

This was a 2D, top down rpg. By top down, I remember there was a view of a map on the bottom screen, and this is where you could see your character, imagine what a monopoly game would look like. The top screen was for when you entered towns, yet you couldn't see inside the town, just a menu would appear and some houses on the background would show up. The menu in towns was things like: Buy Sell Steal I distinctly remember the steal option. It always carried a risk, and there'd be a small punishment but i dont know what it would be. And I think the currency was ""G"" I believe there was multiplayer because there were other cpu characters. The dice roll was like in mario party: you pressed a button and it rolled a dice for you.

You fought other people who also started with three monsters. At the beginning of the game you were asked a series of questions to determine what kind of team you should start out with.

Basically after you beat the final boss in the final dungeon he asks you if you want to leave or do a new game +. If you do a new game plus he takes all of your cards and you restart the game, you still keep your game time but you basically start all over. It’s the games way of making it so you can collect all the cards because after you get to the final boss again he gives you all your cards back (or you get them back at another point, I don’t quite remember when it is but it’s not a huge moment, you just get your previous collection). I assume that the nothing you’re referring to is what happens when you don’t choose new game plus, I’ve never not chosen new game plus. I also have never gone past a second full cycle because I originally played on game boy color but over the years have emulated it on multiple devices and haven’t kept my saves. The mosaic picture is in the church where you summon monster cards from a disc after you get it from beating a dungeon. Completing the mosaic reveals a disc that gives you a monster card.

Want to say the fidelity was somewhere between KQ2 and KQ4. **Notable characters:** I believe you played as a pirate (Not Guybrush Threepwood), and there was another pirate who the player could encounter early on. He would always kill us (my brother, a friend, and me were playing it together) so we never saw much of the game. **Notable gameplay mechanics:** The game similar to the early Kings Quest games, where you would wander around, and pick up things, talk to people, etc... However, it had one big difference to the King Kings Quest games in that you can engage in sword fights with some characters... or at least one character, because he would kill us right away. We never got to see much of the game. There was actually a combat tutorial at the beginning of the game, and it controlled similarly to the 2D Prince of Persia games. Despite the game allowing your character full range of movement (up, down, left, right), the combat system locked you into a 2D plane. **Other details:** My memory of this game is very fuzzy. I played it on a friends, grandpa's computer. It may have been a demo or something. I vaguely recall the protagonist being barefoot and having tattered pants.",1,,,,

But you run around a small map, with a few small buildings and tunnels. You could jump up on top of stuff and throw at people from the roof. There was an ammo limit, and you had to stop and build more snowballs if you ran out. I don't remember clearly but i think you had to get like 3 hits in to eliminate a player. It was only small multiplayer--like 5 people to a map. **Other details:** I played a lot on miniclip, but it may have been elsewhere. It wasn't that high of quality, but still it seemed like it was more developed than most of the flash games of the time.",1,unsolved,,,

I'm pretty certain dragons were a huge part of the game(in terms of enemies) You traveled between towns and caves/dungeons via an over-world map that you actually walked through(Zelda II style) At one point in the game(approx. 3/4 through) there was a city populated exclusively by cat people(like cat ears, tail, fangs, otherwise human) I'm pretty certain they dressed in like bright orange. There is a small chance the game was GBA those suggestions are welcome but im almost certain is was DS. EDIT: Also I'm pretty sure it isn't Lunar Dragon Song.

I used to have loads of Big Fish games at the time, but I have already looked through them and I don’t think the one I am looking for is among them. It was a choice driven game, very similar to Doki Doki Literature club as for the asian style and the fact that the story was mainly told through images and texts. The plot, as I remember it, revolved around a girl that meets someone new (maybe one or two guys?) and she starts being followed around during the day - I think werewolves and vampires had something to do with it but you only found it out towards the end. During the game you had to solve some enigmas and riddles and I remember one being set in a shopping mall. I don’t recall anything else, beside the fact that I was literally addicted to it.

For a long time I thought I was remembering incorrectly as I didn't think playing a game via a TV channel was technology that existed, but I saw a post regarding Sega TV channel as well as certain Zelda games being broadcast via TV which sparked this post. This was played in Israel, so I'm not sure if it was exclusive to that region or if it was just something they were playing over there. This was some time between 1995-1999 (the years I visited Israel). The main character was red, and in my mind is somewhat reminiscent of Shy Guy. Gameplay was sidescrolling, I recall the environment being somewhat desert-y and involving some form of air travel. I know this is a super long shot, but I figured I post anyway. Thanks!",1,,,,

Designed to look like a PC release around the era of the NES, I think. The game cut between two views: During the game, a simple overhead shot of the table, with cards sliding around on it. Between rounds, a first\-person view of you sitting at the table, with your alien opponent sitting opposite and some alien spectators standing behind him. Notable characters: You played the game against a alien \(demon?\), with the prize being your freedom. Between rounds, there were other aliens hanging around behind them that would taunt you if you clicked on them. Each character only had a few lines of dialogue. **Notable gameplay mechanics:** You play three rounds of a card game against the same opponent. The most notable thing is that the rules are never explained to you, with a deck of alien cards. I vaguely remember... five suits, maybe ranging from 1\-5 in value? As best I can remember, the card game itself was a simple trick\-taking game: both players play a card from their hand \(simultaneously?\), and the winner of the trick takes both. Whoever wins the most tricks wins that round. I think I remember the opponent's hand being open, but I'm not positive about that. I remember each ""round"" being more complicated than the last, but not how exactly \-\- more cards in both players' hands, at the very least. **Other details:** It was a short game, with a playthrough being only a few minutes long. I never figured out if determining the rules was actually possible, or if you were simply meant to lose. Comments on the page suggested it was possible to figure out the rules and win, but in retrospect these could have been fake to add to the hopeless, jeering mood of the game.

A friend of the family had this game a long time ago and I was a kid when I was played it and I didnt play it for that long. I remember one excuse the person told me that I couldnt play it was because it was an online game and he didnt feel like paying for the service but in hindsight that may have been an excuse so that I, an annoying little kid at the time, would stop asking him if I could play it when I visited. Some other clues I remember from the game is that: * It was either set it space or some parallel dimension, and you interacted mostly in this headquarters that acted as the central hub. You did everything you would normally do at a hub here: Broke down and sold materials, bought items, gather quests, etc. * You would use a portal to transport you to different worlds, or places where you would complete quests and fight creatures. One of the creatures I remember was called the ""Wildebeest"", although it wasnt like an actual or typical Wildebeest because if I remember correctly, sometimes it stood upright when attacking and it was HUGE sort of like a bear. Enough of threat to be a challenge and annoying to fight but weak enough that it was still a minor enemy. * There were various abilities you could obtain but everything seemed to center around this high tech backpack looking thing that was on your and every other avatars back. * The title of the game was named after the backpack, which Im pretty sure was an abbreviation, and Im sure it was called ""M.A.G"", but every time I google it I either get an FPS called ""MAG"", or gaming magazine covers.",2,,,,

Genre: Platform. Estimated year of release: I played it around 2012/2013. Graphics/art style: Cartoony 2D. It tried to imitate 16-bit platform games. Notable characters: The protagonist, a cartoony kid who had some kind of blue jester outfit. His sister, who was like him but with a pink outfit instead. And the final boss was some kind of wizard who kidnapped her. Notable gameplay mechanics: It was a very typical platforming game, you used the phone's arrow keys to move the character and the center key to jump. I think you had to push giant apples in the first stage but I don't remember much more. Other details: It was a beautiful and long game, quite impressive for such a small phone. The setting of the game was something inconsistent, the first level was set in a stereotypical middle-ages enchanted forest, then later there was a level built around electricity hazards, there was one level set in space where you could fall from level bounds and the final boss was veeery difficult, but was some kind of wizard who had the kid's sister trapped and you had to beat him to save her",1,,,,

So, for example, you'd have an 80% chance of starting in poverty, sex was pretty 50/50, starting country odds were proportional to that country's percentage of the world population, etc. etc. Probably would have played it some time between '07 and '09, was definitely free or at least had a free trial version, and I believe it was positioned as an educational classroom aid. The actual gameplay was fairly simplistic, you could choose profession, seek a romantic partner, try to move and such, and the outcomes of those actions were also driven by statistics.

When I was in preschool, I remember that everyone would get a chance to play what I think I remember as being a computer game. I have almost no idea what the premise of this game was. It may have potentially been a maze or something. All I remember is that the majority of the screen was black, and I remember seeing this white circle with small red lines on it. I'm not sure if this was the ""thing"" I was controlling or just a random icon representing something else. I always pictured as a kid it represented a cat, but I was three and that was probably wrong. I know this isn't much to go off of, but the harder I try to remember it the less accurate it is in my head.

It was made by a company that used to make games about killing zombies, with the same pixelated style. In the game itself, you could move your characters in your turn and enter little huts around the map, getting supplies and stuff, maybe even weapons.

I remember thinking it was pretty high quality for the time. **Notable characters:** The main character is \(I believe\) a customizable character and a teenage girl, and the other named characters that appear are four high school girls **Notable gameplay mechanics:** Comprised mainly of various mini\-games, as well as making choices and walking your character from location to location **Other details:** I'm trying to remember a game I was really fond of when I was younger. I don't remember a lot about this game other than very specific parts of it \(I have no idea what the overall objective of the game was\). From what I can recall, the game begins with your character \(who I believe is a girl just starting high school\) having a dream that is some sort of game show. Within the game show she's asked what she wants to do with the rest of her life, and this then sets up the plot of the game that you now need to choose an activity in high school. Your character has four friends who are stereotypical high school girls. One is in to sports, the other is into art, etc. etc. And you have to choose between trying out their activities. I remember there was a theatre portion of the game that revolved around setting up a production of Romeo and Juliet, and I believe the sports portion of the game took place at some form of summer camp. The game was likely marketed towards younger girls. I was in elementary school when this came out, so I don't believe it would be anything too sophisticated as far as gameplay and such. Also, this may be completely unrelated. But my memory tells me that this game is part of a bigger franchise, although I'm 100&amp;#37; sure it's not a Barbie game. I believe there was also a clothing line sold at Kohls in relation to this game with like collections based around the four friend characters. Although, I wouldn't rely to much on this information because I'm not sure if my mind is remembering it wrong.",1,,,,

I remember one country being represented by the colour yellow and another by blue: The rest is hazy at best, but maybe orange and green? If you represent either colour, let's say orange, and you fight a yellow land and win: you'd take over said land and the game changes that plot of land to orange. I believe the point of the game is to conquer every inch of the map. Throughout the game the enemy can also attack and take over the land you own. In-game: to fight the enemy you'd move your units next to them and the fight commences (think Fire Emblem and Final Fantasy). The units you can command can be human or monsters... I remember specifically that you could move a Lancer who could attack enemies at range, and a Beast Master being an unlockable hero later on. Monsters include Green Dragon and later on a Bahamut, these two I remember very clearly. There's one more game I really need to remember of, but I hope I could get this one out of the way first!

I didn't know how to math as a kid so I nearly always got the question wrong (I think it was asking me multiplication questions and I was literally like 5 or so). When you got the question wrong, it played defeated game show music and the clay guy would melt. Another minigame was 2d graphics instead and was a coordinate map waterballoon fight that kind of played out like the board game Battleship. You'd choose between these kid characters, and I think the setting was a classroom. The game asked you questions which, if you knew the answer, would give you the correct coordinate to ""attack"".

Even beyond official Star Trek games and AAA games that reused sound effects, that was when user created maps really started taking off.

Also the scenes I describe at the bottom might be mixed up between the game and its sequel. They have the same name I believe one just has a 2 on the end I think **Platform(s):** I know for a fact I pyplayed it on a PC that potentially had windows XP on it. I may have also played it years later on windows 95 or windows 7. **Genre:** The game is a puzzle, find the object to complete the puzzle but the puzzle does not have a bar along the bottom with shadows or images of what you are finding. **Estimated year of release:** I remember playing it somewhere it between 2000 and 2010 but the actual release date I am not sure **Graphics/art style:** I think that the colors are somewhat muted and the game is appeared to be lit by sunlight from the windows. **Notable characters:** The mainn character is a girl/woman who I don't think you ever actually see. It is first person perspective and there is a husband who I cant remember meeting. **Notable gameplay mechanics:** One of the big elements is searching for hidden pieces of what I think is stained glass in each level and if you get all the pieces you unlock part of the story. In one scene you are collecting marbles or something small and round. **Other details:** I am going to describe in detail the scenes I have in my head. One of them you come out a, I think your Childs room, and are on a bridge between your house and your parents house with your daughters tree house in the middle. to unlock the door of your parents house you need to collect all the colored crayons and fill in the drawings that were on your daughters tree house. In another scene you are in the main area of the house with the stairs leading up to the top floor. There is a silhouetted picture on the wall and for some reason I am remembering a piano of some kind. In a third scene you are in the backyard and collecting things but I cant remember why, maybe to get into the main floor of the house. I think that the game begins with a C or an S but I am not sure.

Unit graphics/design reminded me of Command and Conquer. Notable characters: Sorry guys, I don’t remember any. Notable gameplay mechanics: Included land, sea, and (I think) air units. Maps were divided into regions, and movement was based around preset points on the map, not exactly hexagonal. When in control of a region, the owner gained that region’s resources. Whenever an enemy unit first invaded a friendly region, the player was allowed to place a limited number of “guerilla” units in the region. Also, this is a bit insignificant, but there amphibious vehicles as well as transports that you could load units into.

Pretty gritty color scheme from what I remember, except for maybe a few maps where there was a bit more color. **Notable characters:** N/A **Notable gameplay mechanics:** Each map had a unique ""instakill"" area that could be activated by a player, and it would kill anyone in range. One map was like a space center, where they launched rockets. The instakill area was a large circular office directly below the rocket. When a player pressed the button outside the office, the rocket would launch, and incinerate the room. Another map was a snowy cabin area, with balconies all around. The instakill was a Power Distribution Center that would go haywire and electrocute anyone inside of it. The last map I can remember was basically, several helipads that were interconnected with pathways, and you could see other players at basically all times, which made for interesting long distance firefights. I believe the instakill was related to a helicopter but I can't exactly remember the details. **Other details:** I seem to remember being able to use a railgun, which could go through walls/people and would kill anyone it hit. *** Thanks for the help in advance!",3,,,,

You and the other character live apart for a while until you two fall in love. You have a child and I think around that time the volcano starts acting up, lava starts flowing out of the volcano slowly. I actually think it was a timed thing too.

We think we played it on a PC online from miniclip. The game had a rectangular character and it started in a house (maybe a kitchen). It was one of the games where you had to solve each level to get to the next, but there was also a story element. There was a trilogy of this game (possibly more if they came out after we lost interest). We think we remember there being a death that you had to solve, possibly the mother of the house you start in. There are puzzles that involved shapes on the floor and stepping on a certain part of the floor to change the color. You had to do it in the right order/pattern to move to the next level. There were also ones that involved keypads and an old TV. One level you had to plug a cord into the wall to turn on the TV. Then there was a tape in the TV that had a recording on it, possibly from a security camera in the house. One level, you had to turn on hot water to make the mirror fog up and reveal a code for one of the keypads. I believe you could have an inventory. There was also a circular ish room that had doors all around it. This was around 2006\-2010 (give or take). The graphics were simple but the story elements made it a rather interesting game. Also, I can still remember exactly the sound of the light switches being turned on (big aspect of some of the levels) and the faucet being turned. Things like that. Please help!! We must knowwwww!!

Played it in around late 90's to early 2000's, so it must've been made earlier then. The game features two characters \- one blue and one pink, in their respective hot air balloons \- and they (or you, as the characters) shoot birds(?) to score higher points. The background is a bit Mario\-esque with the clouds and shrubs. The game is view from the ""top"" \- meaning you can see that the hot air balloons are clearly above the ""background"" land, but they're still drawn from a frontal view? Think Galaga, and other arcade shoot 'em ups. But while Galaga scrolls upward, this game scrolls downward. I also kinda remember the opening animation where the game is in its original view but the balloons are still on land, and the characters go into them, and they rise up to the clouds and the game title floats down from above, prompting for either a 1 or 2 player game.

The game is something like this: It’s a futuristic setting. You play as a red headed male scientist in a white lab coat. You have an evil twin, obvious by his black lab coat, who has escaped and is trying to take over downtown. You play mini games in order to win items (the only mini games I remember for the life of me are this one where you have to fix these grungy pipes that aren’t flowing anymore, solve the pipes puzzle and they have a bright coloured liquid that flows through them; and this other game which plays almost like a tower defence game except the host of that game is like a hulked-out Princess Leia and the towers are slugs with little machine gun backpacks.) These items can either be things that help you in battle (like a cab token which summons a cab that runs over your clone, a helper robot to attack him, things like that) or foils (like a remote control that short circuits the robot). The goal is to not run into your clone until you’ve played enough mini games that you have enough items to take him down, and you think you have the foils to all or most of his items. If you lose, you just lose items and you can keep sprawling the map until you get more items again The whole thing is narrated by a News Robot, who covers stories like where the clone was spotted last, who was with him (or what items he had), and every news broadcast ends with him saying “More news... as it comes in.” Also the fights between the clones is animated, as in cartoon cutscenes",1,,,,

1819,8p0l5z,tipofmyjoystick,(Mostly) Multiplayer browser game with space theme and crass content ca. 2008,1,8p0l5z,1,2018-06-06 15:26:03,BobTheInept,"**Platform(s):** Browser game. I played it on a mid 2000s model Apple laptop. **Genre:** Turn based single\-player RPG/turn based multiplayer strategy **Estimated year of release:** I don't know, but I played it around 2007\-2009. No idea when it started or ended. **Graphics/art style:** Overall, production quality was low. I remember most artwork was black and white and looked hand\-drawn. The space sector map had computer made art assets. Artwork was not animated. **Notable characters:** The RPG part had silly quests and characters. I remember one area where you had to fight General Tso's chickens and possibly General Tso (these were anthropomorphic characters.) The game had a lot of crass sexual content, and I don't remember any particular characters but I'm sure there was a variety of characters with various proclivities. **Notable gameplay mechanics:** There were two distinct game modes. First was an RPG which was either single player, or had very little player\-to\-player interaction. You could visit different areas to complete grindy quests. You collected various items (I think you needed multiple copies of items in some quests). Attempting actions consisted of single checks with pass/fail results, and fights resolved this way, too. I remember one area where you had to collect a bunch of condoms to make a condom space suit. That was needed to access the next area because apparently it was so so... messy in that area. You got to see the second game mode only after completing the RPG part. Until I got to it, I didn't have any idea what it was about, I just knew that there was stuff I hadn't seen yet. Anyway, this part had a sector map of an area of space. There were things in sectors like space stations, but I don't remember what different things could be found. You had to scan sectors or explore them to figure out what was where, and players worked in groups to map out the entire, well, map. For this reason I think the game put players into factions, but I'm not certain. I remember very little of this part of the game, because I lost interest in the game at about the same time that I got access to this part. I don't remember what was the goal or anything. However, I think a *different* set of silly RPG style quests were still available in this part, with the hand drawn graphics. You needed to travel to a specific place on the space map to get to that area's quests. There was one with hydroponics and collecting spliffs. One thing I remember very clearly is that the game regularly reset. When the game reset, everyone would have to do all the RPG part again, gain access to the strategy style game again and start that part from scratch. That's why people had to map out the space areas regularly \-the map would randomize each time it reset. I also remember something that worked similarly to the prestige mechanic in Call of Duty. People who made it to the strategy game could reset their own game to the beginning of the first, RPG style game. That was called something like divit, dimir, dimit. (And dimir only brings up Magic: the Gathering related links, thanks to the Dimir guild in Ravnica) **Other details:** Pretty much everyone playing the game was active in the forums, which is where people communicated about things like what they found in each sector, and just chatting. I remember nudity etc in avatars and such was a\-OK and pretty common. There was a casino section, but I don't remember whether it was incorporated into the game or if it was just something on the website. I remember the cards had adult photos for artwork. The ads for the game said something along the lines of ""Meet aliens, sex them"" or ""Sexy green aliens and space lazors.""",1,unsolved,,,

It kind of felt like a roguelike game. Your father goes missing and you try to find him. I think it was open-sourced and the original developer encouraged players to create levels. Since it was open-source it was free. I don't know if it was on iPhones or not since I had an Android Thunderbolt at the time. I do remember it required a lot of grinding.

The first level unlocked the rest of them except for one (although he's unsure about that) * The levels all had intro videos, so the game had a story, but he didn't understand jackshit, because he didn't speak English at the time * The first level was a laboratory, where you had to find the compoents of a tablet-like device, which you had to buid. From that point, that device became the HUD of the game. Though that device you could, and had to take photographs, mostly ID cards on the first level. * There were other puzzle segments in the game, when you had to assemble stuff * You could scroll sideways with little arrows on the sides of the screen and you could enter doors * There was a level with an excavation where you had to look for some sort of pieces of evidence(?), some old object and at the end of the level you had to do some shit with the photographs * There was a level where there was something with fireflies, they might've been alien, or something * In a level intro, a german shepherd barked agressively for some reason * In a level intro, there was a guy with a hat talking about something * In a level intro, here was some rabbit-like creature screeching * On the excavation level there was some fat guy in a bush who went away when you took a photo of him * The game was mostly scary/depressing and kind of absurd, although the scary part might only be because he played with it somewhere between 2003 and '09, when he was little, and the absurd part might only come from the fact that he didn't understand none of the text and the dialogue * There was jumpscare scene when you had to look into a spyglass in a house, and you saw a weird white face, a ghost, or something * The whole thing had an X-Files feel to it, the site he's found it on might've even advertised it as ""X-Files-esque"" Take all of this with a grain of salt though, if only two or three points from these remind you of a flash game you know, name it please.",1,,,,

I played these on CD all the time when I was little (early 2000's) but can't find anything on them. They were all learning point and click games that I believe were made by the same developer cause they all have similar art styles 1. First one is about a girl who tells a lie (can't remember what about). Then, a little green creature with a bow tie in it's hair appears, and it's a Lie. It's sings a song about being a lie (🎵I'm a lie, just a cute little lie, don't worry about me I slide right on by🎵 or something like that) the lie grows and grows until it becomes the size of a house at the end. Girls confesses, end game. There was a mini game where you had to pick up knocked over VHS tapes at a video store, and throw popcorn into the lies mouth. 2. This was a medieval setting. The goal was to find these jumping beans , each with it's own personality. Can't remember too much about this one, it started with some dude reading from a scroll, and ended at a carnival with a roller coaster that wrapped around a giant. There was a mini game where you had to catch cake as it fell from the top of the screen to the bottom. 3. This last one was about a family (possibly a family of bears?) Who go to a beach. I can't remember how it ends but I do remember a few mini games. One was you had to make a sandwich out of various items in a picknick, and another was you had to find a new shell for a crab (some items were shells, others were garbage like a tin can) he would only accept one and then sing about having a new shell. Im sorry I can't be more detailed, every time I remember them a little more detail escapes me.

Game was a shooter like game if my memory is correct. It was something about people becoming mutants and you control 4? Characters I believe and have to fight those mutants to get out of town...I think... Style wisely I have in mind something like diablo 2.... fight wisely something more like heroes of might and magic 2... but something tells me it was not turn based. Similarly to diablo 2 it had a view from above. When it comes to characters, something tells me the main characters were soldiers but I can be wrong. One thing I remember for sure, and only reason I remember this game is that at one point you meet an infected mutant/human dude who repeats a phrase ""Riding a snake"" (now, that's a rough translation from polish ""jeździć na wężu"" since I played it in Polish). The dude then later does change into an evil one, summons some smaller mutants etc, so initially you could have picked an easier fight at the start when you had a choice whether to take him as a companion or kill him. I was a kid back when I played it with my father and the game just faded from our memory, except the riding the snake guy, if anyone has any idea or just if you remember something similar but not the name, I'll just add that as a clue for when I search for it next time. It's been years that I search for this game but never too actively. Thank you for help.

The appearance of the gold varied depending on the amount ,if it was very little, it looked like a few coins and if it was a lot it was a slightly opened treasure. Also you could unlock the camera and look freely everywhere, I don't remember if it was part of the cheat or not. **Other details:** Mine came with a cheat I believe.

I made a post about a year back asking about this game, so I figured I'd give it another go just based on my memory: The graphics style was CGA based (I remember a lot of purple and blue) and you moved around on a grid plane (As in, you could move up, down, left, and right, sort of like an old adventure styled game, something like Zak Mckracken or Heroes of the Lance, but I believe you used the keyboard to get around). The viewing point was that the top half showed the actual game, while the HUD was the other half of the screen and, I believe, it showed the characters you played as. I want to say the graphical style matched something like Splatterhouse, but obvious with CGA graphics. The sprites were detailed, and I think all of your characters were humanoid. I also want to say it was space themed, as I seem to remember aliens and being able to shoot them. If it helps, I played other games on this computer like Psycho (Which I tried playing again today and is just as terrible and easy to beat as I remember :D), King's Quest I, and EGA World Tour Golf (I may have filled the computer's hard drive as a kid making levels in that). Been trying to find this for years with no luck, so any ideas would be appreciated. Based on some recommendations I had on my last post from over a year ago: -It is NOT a scrolling space shooter! It plays like an adventure game with your character walking around on a plane (Think King's Quest, or for a more modern approach, think the combat sections in Kingdom Hearts: Chain of Memories on the GBA). -It's not Space Quest, this game had a more serious tone with you shooting aliens and/or bug creatures. -It also might not be centered around space, but it felt very Alien-esque, and space just comes to mind every time I think about it.

Hoods and all, but not related to KKK activity. That was the one detail I remember very vividly. **Notable gameplay mechanics:** Don't recall a lot of specifics, but I think radios and bikes were involved (made me think the game was reminiscent/inspired by ""Stranger Things"") **Other details:** It was a short video I saw a few months back (up to a year ago). The video was set at night in a suburban/rural street. I thought the kids solving the problem rode bikes. The game felt inspired by Stranger Things, though had no related plot elements. The plot shown in the video revolved around a mystery of disappearances, maybe brainwashing too (I think it was happening to the parents/adults). Video shows quick scenes of moving through passageways, people in white robes (think KKK-like...). Was about a small group of kids determined to solve the mystery. I don't believe it was the game Hello Neighbor, given what I recall from the video and what I've seen from that game, but it is reminiscent of this unknown game.

It had very vibrant pinks, purples, and yellows for the party modes. ** **Notable characters: No campaign, but enemies, there was an alien horde mode that released before Call of Duty Ghost's did their Extinction mode. This alien horde mode included giant crab-like monsters, as well as giant aliens resembling armadillos. It was a standard run of the mill free to play first person shooter, other than the party modes. There were two party modes that I remember well. -An alien, coop moba mode. Basically you started with your team of 5, went off and tried to destroy these alien eggs that acted as towers in the three lanes, and fought the aliens that spawned on the other side and ran down the lanes to protect it. Pretty standard for a moba, you still collected money and bought upgrades and such. The only catch is it was in first person and it was a military shooter, which I have never seen otherwise. -Three lay glass floors. The only other party mode that really stood out was one where sixteen players would spawn on a 6x6 platform made up on glass panels (with each row of 2 separated by segmented walls). There were three floors, the top was a vibrant green, then the second yellow, then the bottom pink. Everyone had the same weapon, and you could only die by falling through all three floors. You would basically just jump around and shoot at the glass beneath other player's feet to make them fall into the abyss, while trying to avoid the same fate yourself. So, any ideas? It might still be on the steam store, but I can never find it, and I'm not sure how to find a download history that includes F2P games.",2,,,,

The only key things I remember about the game were that when you die you have to do a puzzle of some sort (and throughout the game you are solving puzzles, I believe it was Math related not sure.) and you had to go through a pipe or something (or pipes) in the game. I also think the main character was a fox or Robin hood of some sort. The game in terms of visuals looks like Faery Tale Adventure II, almost.

I wanted to update the community here at TOMJ for a moment, if you would indulge me. The reason for this, is simple, I have a firm belief in transparency and that any community with oversight should be a two way street. Firstly, we are getting a number of questions that all boil down to 'how do I post?'. I'm not going to lie, I remember being a little confused when I first came here, initially, too. I thought that was just me, but clearly something needs to change. Its easy for me to shrug it off and claim those people are silly or worse, but im a technically competent person and very comfortable with reddit. Not everyone that comes here is. Honestly, as small as it might seem, I think the fact that the '**FIND A GAME**' button is *above* the search bar probably has a lot to do with it. Most subs have it under. So, i'm going to be starting a discussion with our patron mod, /u/wipeout4wh about making some changes in that regard, but i'd love to hear from the community. Did you have problems with this the first time you came here? What do you think the issue was, what should we change about the button? ____________ Secondly, I would like to thank the community for all the fine reporting they have been doing. It might seem to the casual observer that moderating TOMJ is a pretty quiet deal, and you wouldn't be wrong, really. But we get more than you might think. Particularly troll posts and advertising disguised as posts. Clicking that report button really does make a difference, and rest assured, *every* report gets reviewed. (Its not that *large* a sub, its not that hard, really.) Your report might get approved, and you might disagree with that, but a human saw it, reviewed it and approved it. Every one. So thank you for your vigilance and doing your part in creating what TOMJ is today. When questioned, no single snowflake believes it is the cause of the avalanche. But you are, you special little critters. __________ So i'm sure you have an opinion. What about this button?",4,not KI,,,not looking for a game

If I didn't have RES or know how to turn off subreddit styles across the board, I would have given up on posting within a few seconds of being here. Its not just the location, but the styling on the text looks like a heading. It says something that doesn't imply making a new post in the slightest (find a game? Is that a search? Is it a link to a wiki or something else?) The rest of the subreddit styling is pretty coherent, but that part breaks most of the rules for UI design. It's not obviously a button- there is no box, no border, it's not the same color as a hyperlink, it isn't in the same place as it would be on another subreddit, and even once you hoer over it, the underline makes me think ""external link"", not ""button"". If you want to keep it stylized, I would suggest either revert the text back to ""Submit a new Post"" like the rest of Reddit uses so that a quick visual scan will show a familiar bit of info to the user, or to make it look like a button again with a border and hover-based highlighting, like ""Submit a new post"" is in a stock sub. With that said, though, app users don't see subreddit style, RES users tend to turn it off in a hurry on subs that change things around too much, and there are others like me who turn it off globally because we want all of the subs we're on to look and function identically.

He appeared in a level as a gift demon type thing, and where he was looking was shown in a red haze, so you could avoid his gaze. Notable gameplay mechanics: A ghost girl thing that could kill you would move through walls by way of black portals. In another level, the giant demon thing had to be avoided, until you could give him an offering and he left. Part of the game was in an apartment or home that you shared with your wife. The TV messed up and counted down from 100 to 13, creepy stuff like that. I think the wife was missing maybe? Other details: I saw this game on a twitch channel called Horror Gaming Network. The problem is he only ever lists the game he's playing as Resident Evil, even when he's not. This was on a few mornings ago. (I ""watch"" while I work each day.) I want to find this game and play it, it looked kind of fun, but I can't figure out what it was. Seemed like it could have been Korean maybe?

From what I remember, it had an overhead view while exploring the map, and when you entered combat (I want to say it had random encounters), it changed to a kind of first-person view like Dragon Quest. I also want to say that the bottom half of the screen had clickable commands for attack/defend/inventory/etc. I believe the section of the game in the demo had some sort of castle or town that you could explore, but there was no loading screen when you entered it, it was just part of the general overworld map.

There was also a web cartoon about a kid that discovers them and tells his science teacher or something and he also tells his friend about it and I think they mention a Kool-Aid oath. The toyline included detailed figures of the bugs, as well as a Digivice type electronic game based on the thing the kid from the webtoon made that discovered the dust mites. There was also an online game that I think used codes found on the figures, as well as a second version that didn't require the toys. There was also a series of YouTube videos made by the evil science lab from the webtoon showing the dust mite being killed in various ways. I think it had the words ""nano"", ""byte"", or ""bug"" in the name, but it isn't HexBug.

Very old arcadey graphics There was small robot looking army men that got upgrades ( become stronger), and eventually you can do a lot of damage to the other team's ( base/infrastructure? ) Honestly it didn't even seem like a big game it might have been some kind of mini\-game perhaps ?

The term 'save scumming' refers to the practice of doing backup copies of a single savegame in the games with permadeath (a distinct trait of roguelikes) to circumvent the finality of death and is generally considered cheating. Sometimes, the term 'save scumming' is also applied to a situation when player saves before a repetitive event and then saves again or restores depending on an outcome to hasten the progress (e.g. when character plays at a casino and player uses maximum bets and then saves after every won game and restores after a lost one). It is a borderline example, because using a feature explicitly included in the game is not a cheat, more like an exploit (but then again, unlimited save there exactly for this reason, so it is not abusing the mechanics).",1,not KI,,,

2368,8pj3x5,tipofmyjoystick,Cult-like choose-your own story film game,20,8pj3x5,1,2018-06-08 13:27:17,elebe11y,"I'm not sure why but the template hasn't popped up like "" **PSA: A guide to better results** "" said it would. (so I copied pasted it instead) **Platform(s):** I think it's played on a computer. I'm somewhat confident that this is only played on the computer (not on playstation or x\-box, or at the very least when I played it/watched a lets play of it\- and this was likely in the year that it came out) **Genre:** Pretty sure it was in first\-person. Horror\-like. Choose your own story game\- plays like a film where every once in a while the story pauses (I think the visuals might not freeze\- instead the actors simply kind of just stay idle), you must make a choice. (I guess that makes it a role\-playing, choose your own story, horror game). **Estimated year of release:** I think between 2013\-2016. My best guess would be 2015. **Graphics/art style:** It's literally just real\-life actors acting. It's not real\-looking people (i.e. it's not one of those games that's used actors to model very real looking digital characters\- it's not like Until Dawn, for example\- at least I don't think so). It's actually just human beings in the flesh\- actors, and real trees, a real house\- art\-style is just someone filming inside a house, and then outside in the dark in a foresty area. I guess it's quite dark\- maybe like a black\-mirrorish vibe. The story is set during some house party\- so it's dark\- outside, but theres you know like dim\-ish lighting inside (party lights rather than just normal house lights). And when you do end up going outside later in the story it is dark outside. **Notable characters:** I'm not great at describing characters. I remember this one white guy, lanky, maybe the slightly nerdy and eccentric type. I'm not sure, but I don't think he ends up the evil guy in the end. The characters are all teens (or young adults). **Notable gameplay mechanics:** I mentioned it in the ""Genre"". This is almost not a game. I mean it is, but it's basically a choose your own story\- but instead of a book\- it's a (short) film. Short meaning like finishing the game probably takes half an hour. Maybe an hour... if you take a long time to make choices? Theres also a chance that I didn't actually play the whole thing/didn't watch someone play the whole thing\- and there were more ""episodes"" of this game. I don't believe your character is given a voice actor\- after you click on a choice\- the characters that were talking to you/are around you act as if you've just said the choice you made. For example: Mark: Should we try opening the door? \* You are presented with a choice of saying ""I think...we should wait here. Let's calm down"" or ""Fuck it. Let's go!"" \* \* You clicked on ""Fuck it. Let's go!"" \* Mark: Oh shit, you're one balsy motherfucka. I might be wrong, but I think this was the case, because the point of the game was really to make you feel like you were inside the game\- that the visuals you're seeing is what the character is seeing\- the game is played through your perspective as the player\- the player is the protagonist. For example, I think they make a point to get the actors to speak to you\- and their eyes look directly at the camera when they speak to your character. **Other details:** (Note: Some of these details might be made up, but I'm trying my best). I believe I first watched this game\- then played it (first watched it on someone's YouTube channel). There's a good chance it was GeekRemix\- the channel I watch 90&amp;#37; of the let's plays that I watch. However, I've tried for an hour to find it there but I can't (maybe it got taken down?)\- and it's not too easy, I could have missed it\- they have a lot of videos. I think the first main scene takes place in the living room of this house party\- you're standing by the couch, and you're talking to two or three people\- there might be a bitchy blonde chick who you have to decide whether or not to do something bad to her\- like put something in her drink or cut her hair or play a prank on her. I remember shortly after, you can end up in the kitchen, but I don't remember why. I think I vaguely remember a brief scene/moment where you take a breather and go outside the house (into like a small backyard?) and I think you accidentally walk in on two guys kissing (two white guys? similar height? fully clothed). And I think they get embarassed. They might've been fairly straight looking guys (You know, like you wouldn't assume they were gay/seem straight enough) I think one of the main characters\- like a close\-friend, side\-kickish type\- kind of really jittery white dude, thin, not particularly short, possibly ginger\- probably blond, is written to seem almost a little too obvious as the killer/evil person (I think we find someone dead early in the game\- not really sure I'm guessing here). And in the end I don't believe he ends up being the killer/evil person\- though his overly jittery, pushy, and kinda large(?) personality really is meant to make you question him. I also feel like at one point we leave the house and furiously go banging on someone else's house\- like a neighbours maybe. And end up getting inside\- two or three other teens/young\-adults answer it (but I am very doubtful of this memory\- theres a chance this is from something completely different). I think other people try to get inside after us (you \+ maybe that jittery suspicious friend of yours) through that door you entered through\- in your neighbours house. I believe the end scene is you wake up\- youve been caught by the evil person/people, have been tied up, and are now in a foresty area\- its quite dark, and some kind of cultish plotline is happening. I think it's also being filmed by people and put on social media/being shared, kinda like Black Mirror or the movie Nerve (not sure I might be making this ""being filmed"" part up). I think the purpose of this cultlike group (I think they were wearing typical cult robes with hoodies) is to like teach some kind of social media lesson\- something about teaching teenagers a lesson\- Im not sure\- some kind of moral lesson relevant to modern society. Reminder: (Note: Some of these details might be made up, but I'm trying my best). Have I posted this in the right place? I really would love to know what this memory is of. Its driving me insane.

May have been pre-Vista **Genre:** RTS I'm fairly certain. It may have been mixed-genre with either RPG or action-adventure though. **Estimated year of release:** Early-mid 2000's, definitely pre-2009 **Graphics/art style:** 3D-rendered in all that 2000's poly glory. I recall the specific level I was on being quite vibrant, but I can't speak for the rest of the game as I only played it the one day and only in that zone. I recall there being a lot of cheval de frise about, especially where your first few infantry units were hanging out at the start of the game/level. It was very medieval in setting. **Notable characters:** A ghost king? Blue-coded infantry? I don't recall much here. **Notable gameplay mechanics:** The typical Age of Empires-esque mouse-drag selection of units and click-here-to-move controls. WASD/arrow keys used to control the ghost-king (who was in 3rd person), if I recall. **Other details:** The thing I remember most vividly about this game is the cutscene at either the start of the level, or the game itself (I can't remember if I began a new game or just clicked on someone's save, unfortunately). A king - I'm fairly certain he was a king - died or something of the like and his spirit left his body (and flew out the tower window? I don't recall). You then played the game as the king's ghost, flying around the area and commanding your army like a regular RTS. All of this is subject to inaccuracy/mis-remembering, of course. I only played the game once and it was a long time ago at that. This game has been eluding me for over a decade (and thus has been driving me insane for just as long), and no matter where or who I've asked, nobody seems to know of it.

You would have an overview map of that island and could click on various locations (such as the forest to hunt dragons, or the city to do some stuff or your own homebase/dragon den) In the City there was a tavern where you could hire people for hunting dragons. I think also in different tiers, so there would be a expensive hunter who would have better chances on getting a dragon and a cheaper one who would have lower chances. You could also modify your dragons, giving them spikes on their tails for example which would make them better in combat. You could upgrade your home with more dens, watchtower to keep dragon thieves out, or a place for a dragon doctor. You would have a finite amout of dens and you could feed them various foods to help them grow (or help them get really fat) I remember also a cheat where you would move your cursor in all the corners of the screen to get money.",1,unsolved,,,

It was story driven I believe and in many missions you would have a base with shields and turrets, along with automatically spawning friendly units. The enemy base would also do the same. You won the level by defeating the enemy base, and would win the mission by defeating the base. Other missions wouldnt include the base mechanic and you would need to get from point a-b without dying. I cannot remember if you could control this in anyway yourself or if it was automatic. **Other details:** Your character felt small compared to the world (i remember it like that anyway) I also remember there being a free demo that only let you play 1-2 missions but you had to pay for the full game I'm hoping some of the things im remembering are not over-exaggeration based on young me's memory.",3,,,,

The plot involves a boy in a kind of carnival and he gets into a cathedral that has a stained glass window with a knight, and the knight comes off the window and faces the boy with a sword. That's all I have (it was a demo in a CD). I think you had to solve puzzles and get items in order to progress in the game, like a point and click, and it was made in old school 3D (very weird polygons man...). I hope anyone can help me.

I played this game as a child, it was a game my father had gotten from somewhere (probably for cheap/free) **Platform(s):** PC **Genre:** 2D top down but it was somehow wonky, like there were higher platforms and lower that you climbed using ladders maybe? Platformer. **Estimated year of release:** This is a large scale, I know but I played it as a child. I was born in 1992 so I'd guess it was between around 1997 and 2003 but definitely before 2005. **Graphics/art style:** The surroundings were quite Super Mario like as were the characters. Maybe a everything was a bit more ""thicker"" and rich in colour. I know, I'm not sure what that means either. It was very simplistic. **Notable characters:** I think that the protagonist was a farmer that was collecting apples and maybe cabbages and carrots etc. Enemies included snails and moles (or were you the mole, I'm not sure) and other animals that you might see in a crop field. **Notable gameplay mechanics:** I don't think there was any way to really kill the enemies, you just had to avoid them to move forward. There might have been some sort of Pac\-Man like feature where you could attack enemies for a short period of time after doing something to unlock the feature. **Other details:** The game was quite difficult for me either because it was difficult or because I was young. Or both. As such I never really got too far in the game. The levels were slightly different from each other but it was always in farm surroundings as far as I can tell. As mentioned above my dad got the game for us and he's cheap, like super cheap so most likely the game wasn't main stream but rather something cheap that he got for free or for a very cheap price.",1,,,,

I remember it was set in a graveyard and as a dumb kid, I found it scary. I think you would go from room to room (you could go in any direction, and once you would reach the edge of the screen it would switch to the new location), but I honestly don't remember anything about the gameplay or how it looked. The only detail that stands out, is that during title screen, or maybe when you died, you would see your character trapped in a grave, from top-down view. The grave was opened, and covered with a grate that you could see through. You could move the character left or right, and he would turn, but not be able to move. I think there might have been two more graves on each side along with tombstones above them, and a graveyard wall along the top of the screen. I'm pretty sure I was playing it on Atari65XE, but it's possible it might have been on CommodoreAmiga500. I'll guild anyone that can figure this one out :).",1,unsolved,,,

I can't remember if there were actual murders, but I do remember that you had to find and give a lot of items to random people. For example, I remember you had to get a pill from your assistant, to cure the hangover of a homeless man who would then give you a free pass to a club that he found on the garbage.

Every server was essentially its own sort of user created maps. Ordinarily you'd have an ""overworld"" with sprites that then went into a battle screeen where sprites sort of floated around while the background remained a static image. Each ""server"" was essentially something people made that could consist of anything using sprites (created their own or ripping them off other games) for example there was one I used to play that was based on castlevania with its own classes and skills. Likewise this was playable solo (if you played the map before) or online where others could pop in. I also remember that the game had ""Cheats"" you could enter as a command which did things but some of these games punished you for doing so.

I remember one disk had about 200 games on it that didn't work but the rest worked for our PC.

The game features six playable creatures throughout the game, each one with six primary skills to defend against Corts' creatures. Before playing against enemies, the player must arrange pieces of dinosaur DNA to enable each creature's skills. Unlike Scan Command, which requires the player to scan barcodes to receive DNA, Dinosaur Battles presents the player with a list of more than 500 DNA pieces. The game primarily consists of the player controlling a creature from a top-down perspective while carrying out tasks such as locating certain facilities.

We do not remember if it was from floppy disks or a CD. In my memory the graphics were close to realistic, not cartoony, but due to the age must not be as clear as i remember, there was definitely some audio to the game also. From what i remember the scenery seemed to be rock/sand with a stream you travelled on in the middle of a canyon. The concept of the game was similar to an escape the room but the only scene i can remember is you were on a little rowing boat, floating down a stream. A bird, i think a raven or vulture flys over head, you pass under a little wooden bridge then on the right hand side is a water wheel and some sort of Mill. I seem to very vaguely remember before this point you had to collect a series of things to escape on the boat. Neither of us ever completed the game but we used to just die inexplicably at around this point in the game.

It wasn't open world I don't think. There was also a part where you acted in the school play I think it was either Romeo and Juliet or Sleeping Beauty. At the end there was also a biking game.

Graphics/art style: Typical 16-bit art style; I’m pretty sure the color scheme revolved around warm colors, particularly orange. Notable characters: You played as a generic space-marine-hunter-whatever guy, who I think had a grey-colored suit. The only other characters in the game were alien organisms, who served as the enemies. Notable gameplay mechanics: It basically played like Metroid Prime, so you would walk round, jump, and shoot in 8 directions, and I believed you could acquire upgrades too. Other details: I remember the title screen being rather unsettling. You would see an image of two halves of a face that each were from two separate faces; one half being the protagonist’s, in his mask, I think, and the other being a creepy alien’s. These two halves were combined to make one whole face. If you didn’t understand that, then try imagining a Two-Face style face, with one half belonging to the protagonist’s, and the other belong to an alien’s.

I'm pretty sure for the starter puzzles where you chose which path to go were both math problems, one across and lava river and one across a normal river. You had to pick the correct tile to move forwards.

I was playing it probably around 1997, but definitely pre-1999. You were a red polygon-esque tank on this black map where there were just dim-yellow blocks/pyramids as landscape or ""buildings."" The edge of the map would be lined by dim-yellow dots on the map that would extend out in lines as far as you can see; if you tried to move out of the map, you'd just vibrate as you made a weird noise. You'd just go around this place and run over a dim-yellow flag and flagpole to continue to a new level that was about the same. Sometimes you'd run into other tanks, but I think they were triangular? You'd shoot at them until they ""died,"" by way of ""waving"" out of existence, similar to an image being rippled out of water, if that makes sense. You'd shoot square ammo at each other that I think was neon-green, and if you got hit, it sounded like a dull metal *thunk*. Your enemies would usually be announced by what sounded like a slightly robotic/monotonous voice saying, ""Hello, man"" (at least that's what it sounded like). You had a circular map of your area on the corner of the screen. Game always defaulted to taking up the entire screen.

Status bar at bottom of screen showing lives and points, maybe one or 2 other bits. The music was chiptune style, and was the same throughout the levels I played. **Notable characters:**In the version I have the main characters sprite has been replaced with a green Clefairy, but as it was very poorly done occasionaly the lives sprite is replaced with the original, which is a green frog of some sort. In at least the first bonus section the extra life you get at the end is another version of this frog, but in blue. **Notable gameplay mechanics:**The only thing that is different from any other platformer is that you can shoot ""bullets"" by pressing B (this is probably a port, so take with a grain of salt). As you collect powerups (they look like limes, but again, shitty reskin) the ""bullet"" gets longer and can travel further. To get to certain bonus sections you can destroy the ground with these bullets, but only to get to the bonus areas. **Other details:**Not a huge amount, the hack was called ""pokemon green"", but as I said above was a shit reskin of an older game (the clefairy you play as was the only pokemon related thing in the game I could find, but I was fairly bad at it).

It was released in the Early 2000's I believe, most likely before 2007. There was a lot of grey, blues and greens. It looked like your basic PlayStation Shooter. There wasn't any characters that comes to mind, I believe the main character had blonde hair and some type of heavy armor like Fallout's Power Armor. Their guns seemed a bit futuristic and would glow blue. The insects were mostly green and blue I believe, they looked like giant dragonflies. Their blood was green. Gameplay felt like a classic Arcade Shooter, that's all I can remember for that, sorry. I only remember playing the first mission. I think there was a squad or group set out to eliminate the threat of insects. It took place on top of a roof where they had to kill all of the enemies and hop on a helicopter. I think there was a giant bug that would stop them before they got on the helicopter and acted as some type of boss. The squadron would occasional give orders to each other as well.",1,,,,

The main characters were a girl and a boy of different species I think. It was in a fantasy rpg type world. It starts with the two heroes beating up a leprechaun as it keeps spitting out gold coins but two villains steal it from them. One of the villains was a gremlin wearing overalls and had a lightning theme. The heroes chase them through various locations. I distinctly remember they went through a frozen place with a yeti that chased them and after they left he starting playing games with another creature. Also they stopped to ask a sky whale for directions but the whale was kinda dumb and didn't understand. I'm looking for this video because my brother quoted the sky whale today and neither of us could find the video. He says ""Are you a sky whale? I'm a sky whale."" by the way.

I have locked away in my head a very specific memory of the start to a games level. Here are the important bits: The game was a 2D platformer/actionish game. The level started on a blue background wall, think ""Outside of a mansions stone fence"" style wall. I believe the source of the blue was that it was nighttime. There was the occasional lamppost, think old british metal lamppost. The theme was ""Returning home"" or at the very least heading back to a location we had been before, I have vague memories of there being text. The character was either a child/very small adult, and had animal features, reminiscent of klonoa Now, here is where things get at their most fuzzy: for the longest time I believed that it was a Klonoa game, but after having seen a full playthrough of its first title, not only does it use 3D models, but none of the stages resemble the one I remember, so it has to be some other platformer. I can at the very least say what games I know it isn't: Anything from the sonic franchise(Have seen lets plays, none of them match.) Nothing from the old starwars games. Mario is right out, I have far better memories of those games. Nothing donkey kong related. The game would have been out anywhere from 1993-2000, as my memories come from before I kept better track of the games I played. I believe it was a Super Nintendo game, but its possible I may have seen the level at a friends house on a different game system.",1,,,,

It's an early 90's 2D platformer set during nighttime where the goal is to return home. You play as a dog that has to help his sleepwalking human friend, a young child, get back to his bed. It also features quite a few lampposts. Since it doesn't match your description 100% I highly doubt it's the one you're after but I thought I'd mention it. Hope you get your answer soon!",1,,,,

3345,8q3088,tipofmyjoystick,"[Windows XP(free)][2000-2008] Fan game: Annoying blue guy with big eyebrows starring Tails, Toad, Zangief, Rent-a-Hero, and Darth Vader. Ogolubryn?",4,8q3088,1,2018-06-10 21:02:35,buttsubushi,"The title of the game is an odd made-up word similiar to Ogolubryn, Oglubryn or Ugolubryn but one of the letters as an double dot .. accent above it, making the name possibly German. **Platform(s):** Windows XP. Came free with on a DVD-ROM with a PC PowerPlay magazine. Remember finding it later on the web on a download/program hosting website like softonic.com. **Genre:** 2D pixel art fan game, some levels are side scrollers with a jump/attack/move controls on the keyboard, is one and two player. **Estimated year of release:** 2000 to 2008, for windows XP, probably would run on NT and maybe 98. possibly would work on vista but it didn't work on windows 7. **Graphics/art style:** 2D Pixel art, like old cheap Sonic the Hedgehog 1. Run has a windowed .exe, no fullscreen mode. **Notable characters:** The Annoying Blue Guy with Big Eyebrows. 1) A sidekick(or the main character) from RENT-A-HERO. Sounds whiny. 2) Tails from Sonic the Hedgehog. Is constantly drunk, deep voice. 3) Toad from Super Mario Bros. Sounds less drunk but voiced by a 12 year old. 4) Zangief (or similar) from Street Fighter (or some similar game, NOT TEKKEN). Only can say: ""You said it, TOE - ADD"" after Toad says something. 5) ""Darth"" (Looks like Darth Vader but if he hovered on his side like a ghost) from STAR WARS (I'm just calling him Darth in this post, it might be something Vergl ). Can't speak, just garbles like a fish. **Notable gameplay mechanics:** You can chose which order you want to do the 5 levels in. All enemies have big eyebrows. Your ""health bar"" is a flat line that grows upwards to become a ""big eyebrow"" and you die when it is fully formed like the annoying blue guy's eyebrows. The game over screen is of a close up of the annoying blue guy wiggling his eyebrows. **Other details:** The game starts with a massive Eyebrow ship and the villain (never seen him from any other game unlike the rest of the characters) is called the Annoying Blue Guy with Big Eyebrows approaches Earth to shot a ray gun at it to give everyone big eyebrows just like him (voice acting is quite something). This causes everyone to become presumably evil and to follow him. He claims that everyone in the world has big eyebrows like him, unless they happen to be in the same room as Orange Tic Tacs and Arizona Green Tea with Ginseng and Honey, and exclaims ""what is the odds of that?"" We cut to the five playable characters Tails, Toad, Rent-a-Hero, Zangief, and Darth, having a ""sick-kick convention"" (spelt with 'shun' at the end) in a crappy hotel room with some Orange Tic Tacs and Arizona Green Tea with Ginseng and Honey. After they talk with each other, they notice the bizarre effects of the ray gun, Rent-a-Hero exclaims ""what was that?"". A dancing hologram of the blue guy with big eyebrows appears on the bed, the game is silent for this part. The game has the option for subtitles, and if they are on the hologram sings a little song on the lines of this: ""I see you have Arizona Tea, Along with Orange Tic Tacs, ... You must collect these items five: Hedge Clips, (four other mcguffins) These five objects you must bring, Or death and destruction I will bring ... But I will not let that happen"" Rent-a-Hero then says ""Oh, I better stop him!"" You then chose which of the 5 characters to play, and then one of the 5 levels based on each of the characters main game, to find 5 different mcguffins. --- In the Sonic World, Tails says ""The only why we can find Doctor Robotnik is with the Chaos Burger"", then a fat guy (looks like he was made in [Interactive Buddy](https://www.kongregate.com/games/shockvalue_/interactive-buddy)) appears from out of the ground (possibly green SMB pipe), says ""Did you say hamburger?!"" and then you have to race a him to get the ""Chaos Burger"" at the end of a Green Hill zone style map. He can just move through the level ignoring the walls, leaving a black cut-out where he has been. SMB has Goombas and Koopas has enemies. I can't remember what the other 3 levels were like, but were much harder and less fun.",1,,,,

When I was in junior school in the UK we played a game on the Acorn computers they had in IT room. It was 2D adventure game where you had to walk around an ancient Aztec, Incan or Mayan city. I'm pretty sure you could collect items and there was a map. It was in (approximately) the year 2000 but a friend of mine also vaguely remembers the game and she's a few years older than me so 1995 might be a better fit. If I recall, it wasn't a Windows\-based game, because the main menu for the computer had multiple OS that you could choose and we weren't allowed to choose the Windows one. If anyone can't point me in the right direction, that'd be amazing!

I have been looking for this for quite some time and can't figure out the name of the game I am looking for. Essentially I am looking for a racing game which did not use any classic racing mechanics at all. You did not race around in 2D or 3D, but you had an overworld on which you had to reach certain locales all around the world, like in Gumball 3000/Cannonball races. The game was in bird's-eye-perspective and played pretty much like a board game. It had a racing setting comparable to that old ""Whacky Races"" cartoon. If I remember correctly, there were traps/weapons one could use. I can't remember if you had to throw dice or determined movement in another way. I am pretty sure that it was a game running on Win95, but it could have been earlier, maybe even MS-DOS.

Could be described as scary. **Estimated year of release:** 2000-2006, maybe very late 90s **Graphics/art style:** 3D models that were I guess cartoony. There was a cutscene with a guy who had a balloon-shaped head. It wasn't *terrible* like most of that era's games look like. I'm not sure if there was lip-sync but if you think of the old Starcraft/Brood War cutscenes it looked about as good, but less realistic faces. The areas i remember were basically poorly lit metal rooms. I feel like it was meant to be a horror game. **Notable characters:** So at like the very beginning you're looking at this blue screen and there's a scientist guy talking who ends up getting killed somehow. The player is on this space station and trying to find out what exactly killed everyone (including cutscene guy). He had black/dark hair and I think a moustache. **Notable gameplay mechanics:** I think you collected weapons/tools like voyager elite force. You walk around like any FPS, but I'm not 100% sure if there was any shooting aliens happening. I never got past the intro, so it either had some kind of difficult fight or was too scary for me to continue. **Other details:** Played this game as a child so I barely remember anything about it. I thought this game was called Dark Orbit, but that's a completely different game. It had voice acting but I don't remember any lines.",2,,,,

The camera crew and presenter would spy on the kids from hidden passages in the walls and trigger these traps at the right moments.

When you got down to the final blocks to destroy, there would be holes at the bottom for scoring and intense classical music would play as the ball lit up with bright colors.

You played as a little vampire who’s nemesis stole his teddy bear, and you had to go get it back. I remember the last level of the game was you going to the “thirteenth room” and fighting your nemesis in a huge metal bear. At the end of it, he gets electrocuted or something and turns into a hideous monster and flies off. You, now that you’ve got your bear back, decide to ignore that and go home to bed. It was a delightfully adorable game, and I’d like to find it again, if just purely for nostalgic purposes.",4,,,,

The looting was like a drag into squares in your inventory like in games like Diablo. (You even get some glass shards as weapon after you get out of your freezer.

NOT tekken-like. You were put in something that looked like a pretty empty arena (portal games come to my mind?) where you fought the enemy. Now, I don't remember if there were only 1 on 1 fights, or more. You could hit with melee attacks, I don't remember if you could shoot. It could have a tutorial in the beginning that took place on the 'arena', I don't know if later on there were other areas. Also, I played this game only myself, but now I have an idea that it might have been multi-player? Sorry for the lack of details.

Some of the small details I remembered about it was that it was based on some sort of island, it was daylight, there was a woman who may have been a blonde that was involved, I vaguely remember a scene where she was in a hallway speaking to a man, and she was (at one point) standing at a dock in the middle of the day with a gun in hand. I also vaguely remember something about it having to do with houses, and possibly seven houses to visit in total. I don't know why I remember that bit of information but I feel as though I should address it anyway. In conclusion, I'm not entirely sure if the game was ever released or if it was, I'm not sure it ever received a Western release. Hope this bit of information helps! Thank you so much!",1,,,,

There was this one game that I thought was called Reuse where you controlled three giants on a circular world to rebuild it after it died. It may have been an educational game, and I think it was 2015 or 16. The plot of the game was that there are three giants that rebuild the world each time it dies, then they hibernate until the world dies again. I can't remember the giants names, but there was a water giant, a leafy giant, and a stone giant if I recall correctly. The player controls the giants on a circular world each level. The water giant can create oceans, the stone giant makes mountains, and the leaf giant creates life. Each level had different problems to solve to get more powers for the giants. For example, the water giant makes an ocean so the forest giant can make a forest, and if you put a mountain in the forest you create a desert on the other side of it. Eventually there are humans on your world that make settlements and have ambassadors that can ride on the giants shoulders. That's as far as I got in the game before I moved to another town and stopped thinking about the weird game ever again. Now I want to find it, but with such a generic title, and limited information, I can't find it. Maybe the developer team was named Reuse, or perhaps it was just that the world was being reused.

I remember them looking like the antedians from star trek, but I'm pretty sure that's my memory playing tricks on me. ***notable gameplay mechanics***: you could send a probe down to a planet and I think on a specific screen get data on the minerals. the probe could also be outfitted with different equipment for different purposes. I think the mission the voice-acted man was upset about was crashing a ship? I also remember the person who was playing the game saying that they thought [the voice-acted man] had done ""it"", which implies there was a mystery involved... I'm sorry there's not much to go on! I'm afraid I had a very limited exposure to it, for reasons I'll not bore you with. I've been looking for a really long time now and found nothing, so hopefully this will work also, it's not iron seed. the game I'm looking for is much more lighter and cartoonish.",1,,,,

There are like fifteen other communities; some you're buddies with, some you're at war with, some are neutral, you get the idea. Your goal is to offer services, negotiate trade deals, make alliances, etc with all these other communities, until you're the most powerful/influential leader in the world. There was no graphics. It was entirely text based. In fact, all you had was the 1980's version of an Excel file, black background, amber lettering, showing all the other groups, their constantly evolving opinions/relationships with you and each other (represented by percentages), and a scrolling Notes section at the bottom keeping you up to date on changing events (such as, ""Group X has declared war on Group Y, Group B has invited you to an important diplomatic function, a famine has struck in Group Z's territory,"" etc.) **Other details:**",3,,,,

First off, I'm pretty sure that this is going to be a difficult task, but I figure that you guys are amazing and might actually be able to find this out for me. I loved playing these games/demos when I was a small child, and I've got one on the way now and I figure he might enjoy these when he gets older, too. With that out of the way, let me list what all names I remember being in this disc: • [Ack-Ack Attack](https://youtu.be/nUGSfJq7Ipk): reminiscent of Missile Command to an extent. I think it ran in DOS. • [Child's Play 3](https://web.archive.org/web/19971222155033/http://alstonlabs.pair.com:80/cplay3.htm): not to be confused with anything involving a sociopathic doll, this was a children's art studio/painting program created by Alston Software Labs. If you saved your work in the demo, it would spam your art with white blocks with black text reading ""Thank you for playing Child's Play 3!"" It had (from what I recall) catchy midi tunes playing in the background. • [Derick the Dinosaur](https://archive.org/details/DCARDS10) - DinoCards: I think this was a board game puzzle involving maths. I can't recall much detail other than you played as a velociraptor and when promoted to answer a math question and you answered wrong, a dinosaur was seen eating the card you flipped for it then laughing at you. • [Arcadia](https://web.archive.org/web/19971222155137/http://alstonlabs.pair.com:80/as00002.htm): There were several mini games in this, and I can only recall a hangman game where instead of anything involving a noose, you had to guess a word with a clue provided (And I clearly remember one being ""A disgusting purple dinosaur"" with the answer being Barney) as a pirate would inch a man off a plank with every wrong letter you typed. Once you ran out of guesses, the man would jump and scream as he dove into the water. Another mini game involved the landing of Apollo 13, and you used arrow keys to steer the craft, pressing either up or space to ignite thrusters. If you landed too hard the craft would crash and you'd hear notTomHanks issuing his iconic ""Huston, we have a problem"" (initiate Mandela effect conversation). Arcadia used the same midis and graphic style of Child's Play 3. And for programs I can't recall the name of, here's a guess at the title or something related to it followed by a description: • French-English: You were presented with a screen with alphanumeric keys (I think) and a white box in the center of the screen that would display the character you typed/clicked on with an American accent male saying what you typed. In one of the corners of the screen there was a button to switch to French, in which the box and characters colors in the center of the screen would invert and when you clicked a character a French woman would say the character. • (Left blank for edits if I think of more) I think this was one of those super-generic '100 Kids Games' that didn't mention that most were demos. There were definitely more than listed, but I can't think of them all at the moment. Granted, I could just download some of these (I know DinoCards has been wiped off the surface of the internet other than a mention by MobyGames), I'd rather just buy the disc if possible and share this childhood joy with my son when he grows older. Thanks for surfing through all that tl;dr! I hope I formatted this right. I'm on mobile and don't often hyperlink. EDIT: I formatted it correctly, but I screwed up the bullet list.",2,,,,

Early 3D polygons for the maze with 2D sprites for the occasional item. **Other details:** Here's what I remember in the game. There is some kind of woman in a tower and she challenges the player to make it through her maze/labyrinths to get to her. I think this woman (she's like a queen or some kind of magical lady) has a crow pet that she sends out to help the player with some tips and advice. You are dropped off into a maze, and I remember the maze being very brown. To your immediate left is a locked door, and behind it is a robot. You have to use the robot to pick up the key in the locked room and make it to the door to make it to the next level. But the robot needs a list of commands to move. This is where the maze comes into play. You have to wander through the maze and find little command snippets such as ""Move Forward"", ""Turn Left"" and ""Pick Up Key"". Once you find the right command snippets, you have to go back to the start of the maze and tell the robot how to move by putting in a list of commands. Once he gets the key, you have to move him to the door to open it, and then you move onto the next level. Also, there are these bats that hang around the maze that will try to steal your command snippets. So you have to throw orange fruit at them to chase them off.",1,,,,

I think it is from the late 1990s to early 2000s. But it definitely is older than 2008. Art Style: The game's art style doesn't really stand out. It most definitely is not cartoony or bright like Mario Kart is. It is not particularly dark though. The closest I'd say is maybe cyberpunk. Even though the race courses and cars weren't based on real things, the art style seemed realistic. The art was not pixel style like 8bit. Detail: A core mechanic of the game was unlocking parts to upgrade your car. I know you could upgrade the wings used to glide off of jumps and the tires. The wings started out like biplane wings. They had an old, canvas look. The best wings looked like steel/aluminum jet wings. I am pretty sure the wings only appeared when you pressed a button to use them. They were not just part of the car. The best tires had a large amount of long spikes on them. There were two ways to unlock new cars/parts. One was winning the race. The other was collecting colored boxes that gave you points. Different colored boxes were worth a different amount of points. If you had enough points at the end of the race, it would unlock something. Every course had a hidden area with golden boxes that gave enough points to unlock the item. I can remember a few of the courses. One was in a desert like area. It was marked with many large black tar pits. Another was in a jungle area. It had a volcano that you would race into. There was one city level where part of it races on a dock like area where construction was going on. It could have been an off shore oil well. I know the last course was in space. It was racing around in what I think was an asteroid beltwith lots of jumps. Notable characters: I don't think there were really any characters or plot for that matter.",1,,,,

Possibly a little bigger. **Genre:** It was a 3rd person style of game, as you didn't look through the ""nanobot"" eyes. It was a turn based game, with fighting (the bots are trying to kill each other), and some strategy(Which bot do I take out first) **Estimated year of release:** It couldn't have been any later than 2013. **Graphics/art style:** Don't know if I remember right, but when you hit/killed an opponent, green blood would splatter on the ground or on your screen. It would also leave a destroyed body in place of that character. It was a cyber area type of place, as it was set in what I remember as a computer chip. **Notable characters:** The most notable one I can remember was a yellow and black/silver monster, with a rounded body. It was very flat, as if it were a blade, and had a crescent part to the top of it's head. It had three pairs of legs, for six legs total.(This is also the mascot of the game) **Notable gameplay mechanics:** You had turn based attacks where you would try to take down the enemies team of three ""nanobots"". You can also buy different nanobots to use in your team. **Other details:** The small device I played on was able to transfer the ""nanobots"" to itself from my computer with the use of a usb. I think it was to level them up away from my computer. After that, you were able to send them back to the computer. The small device also had colored graphics.

I also recall bikini-clad women and spotlights (like, the kind that face skyward at a movie premiere) surrounding each plane on the selection screen. * There was at least one other cabinet side-by-side; maybe there was linked play? This was, however, no later than 1998-9, so that may be a bit too early, especially given that I seem to recall the game looking worse than *Time Crisis*. * The shooting action was on-rails a la *Star Fox* and quite fast. So much so that I felt weirded out at the time that the enemy planes were, for some bizarre reason [Fokker Dr.I](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fokker_Dr.I) triplanes painted like the Red Baron's plane (I had selected the F-14; my father selected the Lightning and played against a bunch of A6M Mitsubishi Zeroes, IIRC, so I think the enemy may've been determined by your plane pick).

I don't remember too much about the video, but it was a third person shooter that featured four players fighting against waves of aliens. Every time you killed an alien, you would get currency, which you would use to open chests that gave random perks/consumables (??) that were scattered across the small area you played in. Once you were finished with that area, you moved onto another one where you would continue to defend against aliens until a boss came out and you killed it. If it helps, in the video I was watching the guys had almost killed the last boss, but had failed. Also, I believe someone in the comment section had mentioned it being a sequel or a remake.

Platform: Mobile - I played on an iPod, unsure if it is available for android Genre: Adventure RPG, fantasy maybe?

I think you both fought a huge dragon or demon at the end or something Notable gameplay mechanics: like 4 or 5 skill slots and item slots, maybe 2 sets that were interchangable like skills vs items. Also you could have guns Other details: You could buy nets and use them on creatures to tame them as a pet that followed, fought, and leveled with you. I had a pet scorpion. At the villages there was always like a campfire you could stand by and heal up at. I think there were placable tents that functioned similarly as well.

Vector graphics with fairly complex animations (coins would flip and bounce). Bright saturated colors, the coins were yellow and I'm pretty sure the HUD / border of the screen was red **Notable characters:** I don't think there were any characters. You controlled an object, I'm fairly certain it was either a ball or another coin **Notable gameplay mechanics:** The game starts and the screen is full of these stacks of coins with enough space between them for you to shoot your ball down (if you were directly above the space). Your goal is to collect as many coins as possible, and I think that each round had a set amount of time or there was a type of coin you had to avoid that would destroy your ball. Once you shot the ball initially, it wouldn't stop until it was destroyed or the time ran out. When the ball hit the stacks of coins, it would bounce up and diagonally, so the best strategy was to shoot it between the stacks of coins so it would ricochet back and forth up the stacks. You collected each coin it hit and the stacks were replenished from the bottom. At any point you could hold the screen and the ball would move in slow motion, allowing you to aim your next shot (with a line preview similar to angry birds or similar throwing games). That's about all I can remember, any help would be greatly appreciated.",0,unsolved,,,

A random FPS game where there was a section where you flew pretty close to the ground and had to wait until your arrival at the right spot, and jumping early would simply result in you dying, there was a turret driving section on a truck right after a warehouse section. 4. A third person game (maybe RPG) with a mechanic where weapons could be kicked off statues, you could pick them up, and you could enter some sort of negative-looking realm which allowed you to pass through walls (although I have no idea if that was intentional, as the camera instantly bugged out, I think). 5.

There was like this floating head of a devil trying to get the player to do really sadistic shit. I didn’t get very far in (it seemed like a short game) but I remember 2 segments. One was you had to pull this lever to make your Grandma (tied in a chair) fall into a pit of lava. The other was you had to nail this dude to a cross. I’m not sure if he looked like Jesus or not.

Educational enough that we were allowed to play it at school as a reward for finishing our work. **Estimated year of release:** I played it during late elementary school (I'm 30), so it was probably released somewhere from 1996-1998 plus or minus a couple years on each side. **Graphics/art style:** What I remember the most is interacting with/recreating fine art. I specifically remember Van Gogh's Sunflowers and some other still life paintings. Possibly some Monet as well but I'm not 100&amp;#37; sure on that. It was trying to be realistic. I remember being impressed by the graphics of the mansion (could have been a museum or big house) setting. I feel like it was probably trying to be 3D because I remember wandering through the rooms of the mansion. **Notable characters:** I don't remember there being any other characters, but it's possible. I just remember the first person nature of it. **Notable gameplay mechanics:** I remember a lot of clicking and dragging type actions to interact with the paintings. Probably point and click as well to go from one room to another. I also remember wandering around a big house/mansion and going from room to room to play games/interact with paintings. I specifically remember placing apples and bananas in the right spots to recreate a still life painting. **Other details:** This was a game that a classmate brought to school (it was a Montessori school) in elementary school in the late 90's. She would have brought the game to school at some point during 1997-1999, but it could have been released earlier than that. I remember searching for the game in stores when I was in middle school and couldn't find it. I never asked my friend for the name of the game and unfortunately she passed away when I was in high school. I don't think it was specifically an educational game, but our teacher would let us play it during breaks or as a reward for finishing work. It was very popular and we would fight over who would get to play. The biggest parts of the game that I remember are going from room to room in the mansion/museum/big house and the paintings/fine art. I've looked through lots of lists and never been able to find it.

I'm pretty sure they were all geared in futuristic white/silver uniforms/armour. The character I remember the most was the largest of the group, which was a buff humanoid robot. Another character could send out recon units like a drone or a mini tank and another one was more weapon/battle-oriented. When you died, you were sent to the last checkpoint via some sort of portal tunnel in 1st person.

I'm not massively into zombie games or anything but it's bugging me what the game is. Doing some searching about I thought it may have been Dead State but google tells me this came out in 2014. What I'm talking about definitely came out before then because I remember watching TotalBiscuit do a WTF Is...? video on it when I was living at my old place so it could not have been later than 2011 I don't think. I don't think he gave an especially glowing review of it or anything, but I am curious all the same. The most stand out feature was that it was isometric, slow paced (I think it was turn based as well but possibly not). I *think* the protagonist was a long black haired dude in a leather jacket but my memory is extremely foggy to say the list. I'm very confident it isn't Dead State though.",2,,,,

Anyway here goes nothing! So to start with I briefly recall coming in contact with the game it must have been around 2015 or 2016 or maybe early 2017. As to when the game itself released, well I think it should have been around the same time I saw a video about it.(I m sorry that part is very vague) Now to the genre it was an indie point and click adventure I'm quite sure of that apart from that it was in 3D and 3rd person so no sidescroller game. It was kind of cinematic but not to an extended of something like until dawn, it was rather move your character from a to b solve puzzles find information and so on, no quick time events or anything like that. Finally the setting and plot: The game was as the title depicts set in a post apocalyptic world. You play two roles which you constantly switch throughout the game. You are either in the past or the present. In the past the people tried to safe themselves (from a nuclear holocaust I think) by hiding inside bunkers in cryostasis. In the present these people have resurfaced and build small settlements and the like. I'm not quite sure but I think you start in the past as one two engineers or I don't know as a facility management team which are inside of such a bunker where they are supposed to run some last checks to ensure the safety of the bunker and keep it secure so the people inside won't get hurt (or die or reawaken) until the earth is rehabitable I think. The latter one is set in a time where some people have resurfaced and build a settlement or something, they happen to stumble upon said bunker which has for some reason never opend neither do they get any life signs from it (clearly something must have gone wrong) and thus they send a team of two people inside to check out what happend or to scavenge it (I don't recall their intention could be a mixture of both for all I know). Anyway that's kind of the whole premise of the game you switch between those two party's and get to see the story of what happend within said bunker and why all the people inside are (dead?) gone. I hope that my rough information of the game or atleast the way I remember it helped to kind of sort it out and that you've actually read my post '^^ If anyone has any further questions on details that need to be explained feel free to ask I will ofcourse try to answer. Thanks for reading my question and every effort on finding said game. :D Have a nice weekend everyone.",2,,,,

Can you remember any other types of units or buildings? Can you remember any music from it? If you can, go on vocaroo, record yourself singing a bit of it, and post it here. It might jog someone's memory. Were there unit portraits? If you remember any you could throw together a quick mockup of one in paint, or for that matter anything else visual that you can remember.

They instead spent several hours trying to cross large ponds and acid pools by standing on a barrel, then reaching behind them and picking up a second barrel to then drop in front of the first. At one point they had to back track quite far to collect the barrels again because there was another giant pond. The whole time they thought the design was intentional and that they were smart for figuring out a way around it.

If I remember correctly, the character gets teleported to some weird land and has to fight and train these creatures to fight. I don’t remember anything else about the plot.

Your character would level up and gain more turns to use per session and become more powerful. I seem to remember running into a lot of slime monsters, some of which could be pretty strong. The interface literally just looked like clipart and you would click one of the pictures to perform an action, one of which was tithing, which helped you somehow, but I’m not sure to what degree.

You could switch between a top-down ish camera to a third-person close up view. **Other details:** The game started on these idyllic floating islands, and it was the 'hub world' where you had to go through a portal to get to the next level. Level 1 was strange purpleish caves while level 2 was this underground catacomb/sewer area. There were traps that could kill you in this game, the one that I remember distinctly is in the second level. If you took a side passage, you could find this conveyor belt leading to a machine like a furnace, with either a person or a person's skeleton strapped onto it (don't recall which). If you pulled the lever near the machine, the person/skeleton would be dragged into the machine and either ground up or cooked alive (again, don't remember which) and you would get a dialog message something like ""You've done something evil"" and would die if you tried doing it again.

(Not Asteroids{1979} but similar in look),3,8rh4jd,1,2018-06-16 06:39:58,KicksArt,"**Platform(s):** PC (Windows 98) **Genre:** Top Down Space Shooter **Estimated year of release:** I remember playing the game during the late 90's/early 2000's. **Graphics/art style:** Visually the game looks VERY similar to Asteroids (1979). However I believe the background had white dots to represent the stars of space. There were multiple types of enemies but the bigger enemy ships were shaped similar to the Star Destroyer ships from Star Wars. Both your ship and the enemies were outlines of shapes just like Asteroids from my memory. There were no planets either, just space lol. **Notable characters:** None that I can think of. **Notable gameplay mechanics: (THIS IS THE MAIN PART I REMEMBER)** Before entering gameplay, you'd click on a map to place any number of ships on your side, and also enemy ships. So you could basically create your own combat scenarios -- large force vs. large force, you vs. them all, etc. (This creative freedom was the source of the addictive gameplay.) - Asteroids-style controls. There were pre loaded maps you can hop into with ships already placed. I believe once all the enemies were destroyed the game didn't end. Meaning you could move around the empty map until you decided to leave and play another map or do the same map you just made. **Other details:** I don't think I was tech savy enough to download the game online at the time so I'm assuming I got it from a CD given to me with multiple games on it. I remember I would select a pre-loaded map that had a ton of allies/enemies in the center and I could place allies far away from the action.

It was a wonky kinda game, with bizarre humor and taste. **Notable characters:** Main character was a man. Many characters were horror like, goblin, skeleton, etc **Notable gameplay mechanics:** point and click, there was a compass on screen, compass was buggy/confusing **Other details:** I saw a youtube video noting how this game used backgrounds from the wolfenstein game i linked above, but i cant find that video...and this is why im trying to find this game again. It's one of those weird wonky games that isnt truly polished, its sorta bizarre like ""i have no mouth and i must scream"". Though compared to ""i have no mouth"", its not well made of a game. And also, this game was 20 years in the making and originally had a prototype version of it released with the same starting area and characters and dialogue, but it was on old software like ""monkey island"", or ""loom"" way back in the day.",2,,,,

You can produce goods in towns if you buy land and invest in a business and place them inside or outside the towns outskirts. You have competitors which are AI that has a similiar goal in mind as you while they are trying to ruin your business. 3. It isn't any of the Anno games, Port Royale or Sid Meier's Pirates. 4.

There were cars with different stats, made by different manufacturers, but each manufacturer was connected to a country, so you were racing for Britain, USA, Japan, etc. They were cars though - not flyers or hovercars.

Deliberately retro **Notable characters:** I can't recall? **Notable gameplay mechanics:** Not interactive fiction with a standard parser. It was key presses to select options in each area. The overall style felt a lot like old BBS door games, like Legend of the Red Dragon. Specifically there was also some mechanical limitation that you could only play so much per day. Though this sounds like an online thing, I had it just as a standalone file. As far as I can recall, it was deliberately set up that way, to mimic a lot of the style of the BBS games without actually being one? I am pretty certain it was also created in 2008-2011 as an game that was a throwback homage to older ones, not something old that I rediscovered then. But it was definitely \*not\* browser-based. Gameplay consisted of roaming around a world/kingdom with forests and mountains and caves and stuff. You fought monsters, and through solving puzzles and exploration learned spells that helped you further explore and etc. The exploration and mapping areas and uncovering secrets was the real draw of the game. **Other details:** I played this at work, like 30 minutes a day, and so I'm pretty certain on having played it in that exact time range. I originally found it off of some mention on a gaming site at the time, so I think it was like a small, lesser-known game by a indie creator, and I've been totally unable to track back to anything sounding like it since. The main thing that really sticks out to me was the limitation of only playing a certain amount per day, as not many games do that, particularly not ones that aren't online.",1,,,,

I played it between 2000-2002** **Graphics/art style: It was in 3D, or as close at early 2000s was to 3D. It was blocky.** **Notable characters: I believe the protagonist was an ant, and you had to go get colorful keys to unlock colorful gates. Teal key for teal gate. I know that the 3rd level, I think part of the level had you talk to someone on a throne. On the 4th level, one that I never manages to pass, you have to jump on the back of a waterbug and avoid a fish jumping out an attacking you.** **Notable gameplay mechanics: I think the arrow keys were used to move and the mouse, I do not think I used the WASD to move.** **Other details: You moved as an ant/insect through an area with dirt on the ground, you are below glass level so the grass acts as walls, You move through certain gates whenever you find a key, purple gates and light blue gates are what sticks out to me. I have no idea what it is called, but I know it probably was not too complicated to install since I know I managed to install it on my fathers computer when I got home from class.

We had both of these consoles so i don't know which one this game was on. They were basically NES rip offs worked with cassettes. We played all those iconic games like Contra, Duck Hunt, Pac Man, Super Mario etc. so I believe this was a NES game. Me and my brother used to play this game early 2000's. It is a single player 2D side scrolling beat em up. I remember that there was a character selection menu at the start and 4 green characters. So we always thought this was a Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles game. Recently I looked up for TMNT games on NES and found out they were very good looking games. This game i'm trying to find had very bad visuals. Environment, colors and backgrounds were very similar to the original TMNT on NES but looked much worst. We never became sure if those characters were TMNT characters because they were just green with no significance. TMNT on NES looks very clear. This was a blurry game. I also looked TMNT ports on another systems but could never found something similar to this game. First level was in a basement and there were some electric platforms can damage you and enemies if stepped on them. It was like a generic beat em up with very bad visuals. You have to beat every enemy and proceed and some new enemies again. Game takes place mostly on underground tunnels. One of the reasons we linked this game with TMNT is that there was a motorcycle level on a bridge. While running over enemies in the same side scrolling style protagonist could use some kind of equipment to shoot enemies in front of you. I can't remember that was a gun or something else. There were some platforming segments and some levels had bosses.I remember there was a boss look like a green poop. And the same thing on grey skin on another level. They were just shooting red fireballs at you and you had to dodge their attacks and punch. Enemies looked like ninjas and had swords if I'm not mistaken. I don't think protagonist had any special ability. Your green character could only punch and jump. If you owned these Micro genius or Game star consoles there is a big chance you owned this game. Those were some fake consoles and I think there wasn't much of a choice of games.",1,,,,

Each player starts with 7 cards. There is a pile of cards facedown where you draw cards from (until it runs out). The first card from the deck is placed and the first player has to play a card that is either higher than that card or is a special (I believe specials are 2 and 10; i think 2 moves all of the cards into a separate discard pile and lets you play another card and 10 just lets you play any card, but that may be backwards). If you can’t beat the card or play a special, you have to pick up all of the cards from the pile (not the ones that have been discarded by the 2 card).

There were LOTS of monsters to find, and if you put your own money into the game you could buy some of the monsters. The first area of the game, you were on a beach area, and then you could walk around and discover more areas and monsters. They were npc you could battle and win money from.

You didn't see them though, it was just a disembodied voice/textbox saying this. So the next level was the same dungeon environment but gameplay was slightly altered. (for example after it takes away your legs you can't jump anymore?) This wasn't gory or anything just simple game graphics. Probably pixel but I can't remember that well. At the end I think the spirit just kills you because it's so annoyed but you play one more level as a ghost where you're invisible (like you actually have no sprite) but all the game mechanics you lost are back and then it realizes nothing will work and gives up.

But the things I can remember, I do clearly. You played a guy in a big spaceship, which you could walk around in. It was a side scroller by the way. You could travel to different worlds by navigating from the bridge and you could even land on planets. The ships computer was able to tell you some things about the planet, like if the air was breathable and stuff like that. On planets you could die to many things, easiest way sometimes was not putting your space suit on. Sometimes after visiting a planet the ships alarm could go off, warning you about a blind passenger. In that case you would find one of many strange alien creatures in some part of the ship, which you had to kill. This is all I can remember right now. Maybe there was some kind of top down or side scrolling moving around with the ship, but I'm really not sure. I really don't know what the great goal of the game was, but I found it very cool back then. Lately I somehow came to think of that game again and I hope that somebody knows what I'm talking about.

Spawn on a uninhabited (no players) planet. Die repeatedly to wild life in the dark until the sun rises. First person. Begin building settlement. Npc civilian versions of you in your city. Build different buildings for different productions. Sun goes down, realize you never made streetlamps. Stumble around in the dark for an hour trying to make lights. Continue to build and start designing ships, realize how far away you are from actually building those ships. Keep trying, someone took pity on me and flew me around in their ship. I stopped playing shortly after. Graphics were total shot, game was free. Universe was VAST. Ships were designed like ""rooms"" I think? I was young. I think I remember the game had a major population problem. People would make a new speices, and go it alone, fail, and quit. While more determined plays got to big to manage alone.

I don’t know what date it came out. I don’t remember getting it because I just remember being there. I think my dad might’ve burned it onto a blank disc because it didn’t have a logo or anything. It looked like a typical CD that you would buy at the store. It’s cover was green though. It had all the characters from Winnie the Pooh. There were activities that you could complete like looking for Eeyore’s tail. The one that my sister and I enjoyed the most was the one where you could bake with Rabbit.

Just had that. In fact, I woke up and immediately went to this reddit to try to solve this... I KNOW this game exists, but I'm not totally confident of my dream-memory, so I'll divide my information into three categories. What I'm ALMOST CERTAIN is true: - This game was released somewhere in the 90's to early 2000's. - The graphics were either early-3D or more Doom-style fake 3D; it looked good for its time but it definitely was a game from years back. - The creepy mushroom world was semi-secret. You had to go into a basement, look for a vent/gutter that wasn't terribly obvious, then muck around in a tight area under the basement till you found an incline going down into a pit; this lead to the mushroom area. - The mushroom area had lots of mushrooms, obviously; it was a big labyrinthine cavern full of them. There was ordinary mushrooms, mushrooms that poisoned you when you got too close to them, as well as the rare mushroom that could heal you if interacted with. What I'm PRETTY SURE is true: - This was a PC game...I think. Though it could've been PS1 possibly too. - The mushroom cavern may have also have creepy fauna. I kinda remember a giant grub/caterpillar than dug out of the ground and attacked you, for instance. - While this was a first person game, I don't remember it being an FPS (or not heavily). I think the game had a focus on exploration and not combat. - What made this creepy mushroom cavern so interesting is that, as I said, I'm pretty sure the rest of the game didn't have a combat focus, and didn't really try to kill you. I feel like it the rest of it was maybe a first-person educational game, or something generally more chill. (I'm for some reason thinking of the PS1 Pac Man museum games that let you roam in first-person between the games as I say this, but I don't think those had what I'm remembering...) So the mushroom cavern was VERY much out of left field, and I remember it scaring me quite a bit as a kid! What might be totally not true but I may as well mention: - Just remembered; as my dream 'ended' I, still in the dream, searched up the game on YouTube (somehow) and found videos on it by somebody with 'Oatmeal' in their name. ...This is probably just the end of my dream screwing with me and is probably not true, but hey...maybe it's a lead? Thanks, anybody who reads this and maybe has a tip or suggestion! This seems to be a repressed childhood memory for me... I really want to revisit it! :)",1,,,,

No, that's not it. But good guess! LSD is pretty awesome, and definitely has around the same 'graphics fidelity' as what I remember for this mystery game. (Though I think the mystery game has more detailed textures.) The passive first-person style is very similar too.

This is a game I played when I was very young, around 6-7, but not knowing what it is has been nagging me for years now. I spoke to my brother about this a few months ago, he mentioned that he couldn't remember either, but that it might have been a demo of a full game, of which we only owned the demo. **Platform(s):** Windows, at least XP from what I can remember. **Genre:** Gritty, realistic first-person shooter set in WW2-era. **Estimated year of release:** Early-Mid 2000s (2000-2007, most likely) **Graphics/art style:** Dark, gritty, realistic (for the time), fully 3D. No weather system, if I recall, but I remember the skybox being particularly overcast. Lots of ruined buildings, rubble you can walk over, etc. **Notable characters:** I don't really remember the hard details, I do recall some other AI teammates, when I played it, never lasted long. All soldiers, there's only one section that has a functioning (yet non-moving, from my memory) tank that fires upon your squad. Other than that, it's all soldiers. **Notable gameplay mechanics:** There might've been some AI companions you could fight with, but I mostly remember braving it all alone, either due to my sheer incompetence or scripted deaths, I'm not sure. I don't remember the mission objectives, there's a few sections that are clear, but for the most part I don't remember the actual objectives, other than kill everyone and survive. **Other details:** There's a section where you fight a tank with limited RPG ammo, that you pick up from a destroyed truck. Facing the tank, there's a field to the right, and a section of destroyed buildings to the left you can hide in. There's some commentary on the tank from ai members, but they quickly die if you don't take it out. I don't remember the tank moving, I just remember blowing up a lot if you stayed in its view for too long. Later on there's a section in a field with a destroyed church in the center. Mines surround the church, and there's a lot of craters around the church from artillery/mine explosions. The church has a sniper in it somewhere that takes shots at you, and you have to move from crater to crater using them as cover. As a completely unnecessary sidenote, I remember printing out a screenshot of the game in full colour, depicting the entrance to a ruined building over some rubble. I have since lost it, but I remember my parents being quite angry with me for printing out a useless full-colour screenshot. Thank you for any help, sorry for not providing a ton of details, my memory is quite fuzzy, but this has been on my mind for quite some time now, and I could not for the life of me figure it out without buying every WW2-era videogame from the early 90s, thought I might as well try [r/tipofmyjoystick](https://www.reddit.com/r/tipofmyjoystick).",1,,,,

I remember us laughing our asses off, since then I've never seen this game again. A few times over the years I've actually searched for it on google etc, no results. Hours of searching leading me nowhere. Description of the game: A ""retarded"" (as in insanely out of this world stupid) knight goes on a quest on a weird looking horse, the game is a sidescroller and starts out with a dialogue with the king in the throne room. The knight has a strong jaw and blonde hair, thinks he's the shit. Comedy/adventure game. Help finding this game would be very appreciated.",1,,,,

I think it was some sort of prison, that you should escape from. Most of people on the map are hostile, and if they see you they will set alarm and you'd be killed pretty fast. So most of the time(on that level at least) you are trying to be stealthy. For that there is view where you could see sight cones of NPCs. But there was also friendly characters that you can speak and they give you quests. One of the first tasks was to get to this kind of NPC who, as far as I can remeber, working out in a gym on that map. Then there was task to steal some papers from office on that same map. I haven't got past that first map, and I don't really remeber much, so take this with a grain of salt. Techology level in the game I think on XX centrury level, although not sure.

The details are as follows: Platform: PC, although it could have been on console potentially Genre: Racing, however it focused on free roam and mission style gameplay Year of release: Should be within 2000-2004 as that’s when I mainly played those games Graphics: While I don’t think they have aged well now, it was going for a realistic look at the time. The game had a city map that I would describe as an American bay town. Maybe like New York? Notable characters: While there were only cars, one of the main cars looked similar to a mustang and I believe that was the default car. I think there might have also been an opening cutscene with some generic action movie people as well but I can’t be certain on that detail Notable gameplay mechanics: One part of the game that I remember was the jumping, which had proper ramps and the such. There may have been a chase mechanic to it and some destructible environments Other details: I remember the area where you first spawn into the level. You start right by the coast, with a large building on your right. Behind you is a long bridge that takes you to another part of the city. Drive past the building on your right and you see the ocean where jumps for missions were usually set up. If you went left you’d go into the city.

If you hit a wrong ingredient, or an ingredient out of order, or if you let an ingredient pass you by, you lost your combo. There were also spices and sauces that gave you style points.

I also remember one of the early maps being a beach shack. **Other details:** - The name was like ""Crazy Chef"", ""Ninja Chef"", ""Krazy Cook"", something along those lines. - A couple of years after release, there was an update that gave the chef a ninja's outfit by default.",1,unsolved,,,

Unfortunately my memories are not vivid enough to remember what it was called. So my description would have to do. It was an FPS where you threw custard pies at clowns that were different colours depending on their difficulty. I can't remember for sure, but I think your character was in a wheelchair and i THINK you could see like a broken leg on screen as part of your FPS vision character? You where roaming around (what It think was) a sunny hospital. I think the premise was that your parents got you clowns to cheer you up, and you had to get away from the clowns. It could very well have been an old shareware game that was local to me. But I remember it ran on my old windows 95 machine. Graphics were super cheap. Everything was a sprite with like 3 keyframe animations. Any ideas?",1,,,,

Units: The vehicles in the game were Davinci design like , this [image](https://i.imgur.com/lvF2jAe.jpg) should provide some ideas. Specific details: Each team had their own leader Unit he was a Pharaoh like man , one condition of winning the game was to capture the enemy's leader unit and bring it to this unique building which was like [this](https://i.imgur.com/YvZXpAI.png) , the captured leader was chained to the pillars and you could have your own leader do a ritual on the building that would make the bridges fall down and when the last bridge was destroyed the captured leader was disintegrated and victory was yours. Only one unit could capture the leader , that unit looked like a hunchback. Audio clues: back then i didn't know English very well so i might be wrong in this section.

Could be early PS3 or the Xbox 360 though. **Genre:** It was like a free-roam game where you drive cars? Like GTA but I'm not sure if there were other people you could beat up like in that game. **Estimated year of release:** Early 2000s-ish **Graphics/art style:** Meant to look realistic, but probably looks bad now. Mid PS2 era so it kind of looked like GTA 3? But it was more summery and well lit. It might have been on Xbox 360 or early PS3 as well/instead. **Notable characters:** I don't remember any characters but I think the main character was the only person? I could be wrong though. **Notable gameplay mechanics:** The one thing I remember about this game that set it apart from other GTA clones was the replay mechanic. If you did something in this game I remember you could rewind the tape and watch it back as well as fast forwarding/rewinding and controlling where the camera was. I think you were only allowed to do this when you died. I'm pretty sure it wasn't Skate 3 because I remember driving in a car? But I might be wrong. **Other details:** I only played this game for like 30 seconds. I was at some guy's house and we were playing it in his room, which is why I don't remember much. I think I was using a PlayStation controller and I remember the game was sort of set in summer.

You only controlled one character. I also remember the enemies as the game went on would change color to indicate them being stronger. It was set in some sort of a fantasy and/or medieval setting.

I remember some of the key things you have to do in-game; 1. Build a ship fleet of your own and sail the ocean, 2. Face rivals (mainly it was like a blacklist and I remember the 2nd Boss was Blackbeard and the 1st one was a Morgan) 3. Treasure hunt, you can find maps of some sort and goto islands in search of thaf treasure, 4. Escape or fight random pirates on the ocean (you would encounter bosses randomly on the ocean as well) 5. The speed is dependant on your fleet, if it is huge, the speed will be slow and vice versa. Speed is important because when you encounter a rival you know you can’t defeat, you’ll have to flee. 6. You can also get captured and escape. My memory is a little blurry here but basically you’ll have to sneak around the island and get to the beach where your ship will await you along with your crew. 7. You can combat long range or you can board a ship and fight with swords using NUM keys. Those are the highlights I remember, I am unable to find the name of this game or even a link to download. Any help finding it would be appreciated and would certainly make my day! Thanks!",1,,,,

The goal was that each turn you could move *or* scan *or* drop a depth charge/torpedo and the goal was to find and destroy the PC's subs. If you selected ""scan"" and there was a sub within the range of the vessel (each vessel had a different range) then the map, which was sectioned out into octagons, would draw a large white octagon centered around the ship and one of those white octagons contained a sub. The key or trick was to find a sub with one ship then ""triangulate"" or ""octalocate"" the sub by identifying where the two white octagons intersected...which would be the location of the enemy sub. **Other details:** The game was encountered on a shareware disk in the mid 90's. The shareware version included 1 map only and you could buy the game to get all the other maps. It ran in MS-DOS but I remember launching it from a Windows 95/98 PC. I do not believe it was made by Apogee software, which was a big player in the market back then. Reminds me of an ""upgraded"" version of battleship except instead of 2 directions (up/down) it is 8 due to the octagonal nature of the play field.",1,,,,

Triangles was a puzzle game were there were paintballs moving across a map of clickable triangles and you had to get them to their destination without letting them touch each other. Gold Miner was a game where you played as a gold miner collecting gold and digging through dirt while avoiding snakes and ghosts and other enemies like that. There were also powerups, like ones that helped you dig faster or run faster. There were other games that I don't remember quite as well, like one that involved a 4x4 grid of letters that you had to quickly make words using in a certain amount of time. **Platform(s): PC** **Genre: Puzzle probably** **Estimated year of release: Early to mid 1990s?

In high school, they showed us a movie about the perils of giving in to peer pressure. Instead of a normal filmstrip about, well, people who could be our peers, we watched a dramatic reenactment of a game show where people and their loved ones had to do increasingly shitty things to each other to win prize money. I remember the first challenge was to slap your loved one in the face, and one contestant, a middle-aged black lady, didn't want to slap her son (college aged kid I think) but he insisted they need the money, so she does. Eventually they get to the final round and it's the people I mentioned before and a husband/wife team. To win the prize money, they need to play Russian roulette. The son argues with the mother, but she shuts him down, saying she's never told him this, but he's her favorite child and no money could ever replace him. Meanwhile, the husband puts the gun to his (unwilling, I think) wife's temple and takes a shot. No bullet in the chamber. The game show host asks the woman how she feels and she gasps, ""Rich."" I've been wondering what the HELL this was. If it was meant to be a PSA type movie, or just some random drama, or what.

Picked up animation showed a hand and could swing and throw the characters. I believe you could spawn a set amount of characters, and make them work towards a goal area on the map.

6446,8sb1yb,tipofmytongue,[TOMT] [GAME] Sci-Fi Third Person Shooter from 2000-2006 where Humans have developed on multiple planets and an alien empire is hunting them down.,4,8sb1yb,1,2018-06-19 20:08:46,Voidjumper_ZA,"Hi there, I'm trying to remember a PC game I ended up playing as a young teenager. I'd estimate it was released anytime between 2000 and 2006 based on how I remember it looking. I'll try to list absolutely everything I can remember about this game. It was a sci-fi third person shooter. I have a feeling it was taking some heavy Halo influences. The basic premise seemed to be that Humans could develop on multiple worlds. You were a Human on some world that wasn't Earth. Very early on a militaristic alien empire invades your world. You find out that Humans are somehow special and that this empire is hunting them down as soon as they find a planet where Humans have developed. Somehow during this attack you gain powers of some sort due to Humans being this special messiah-like race. You could use these abilities in conjunction with regular weaponry to defeat your enemies. At some point I think your planet is destroyed or at least invaded by this alien empire. They had either four arms or four legs and two arms, but I'm positive they had a total of 6 limbs. IIRC their colour-scheme was red and black. However you are saved during the invasion by another group of aliens who are wary of the harm it could bring them, but do know Humans are this special thing. They had very a purple / greyish motif and their ships were, IIRC, very biological or ""space elf"" looking. It's these aliens which explain the plot to you. The cover was very yellow with some slight green and orange influences to it. I believe it had your main character floating with his arms extended behind the title font but I can't be sure of that. I have a suspicion the title was some sort of single term like ""Revelation"" or something equally as ambiguous. I have a feeling the game either wasn't very good or just extremely unknown since I don't remember ever hearing about it outside of me owning a copy of it. And even then I think I scored that copy for a couple bucks at a second-hand store. I'll happy try to answer any extra questions you might have about it that might help us narrow it down. Thanks in advance.",1,,,,

This was probably a turn based RPG game from what I remember and has a unique art style it had a fantasy like almost anime look to it. I mostly remember some gameplay and the fights were almost like brave frontier it was a 3 of your heroes versus 3-6 AI enemies and each character had its own abilities or ultimate and I think the game might have been 30 dollars on release. It was popular on Twitch for like a week and completely vanished. Hope this is enough info :/ Oh and also this is not Pyre it's almost related though.,2,,,,

I remember that it was to teach you about science using puzzles, and all I remember is one of them involved convex and concave lenses and mirrors. You had to add the mirrors and adjust the angles to fit certain colored lasers, which would split the lights, mix the lights, or angle them, which would solve the puzzle. I believe that the plot was trying to help a band with their light show, but I genuinely don't remember. It was in a kind of cartoony/2D style, not real life or 3D.

The game starts out as a point and click/visual novel(ish) where you navigate the world by pressing arrows that lead to different places. I don't remember any specific interactions other than text popups when navigating the world. From what i remember the main character finds a dead girl in a park with a similar cellphone as she found earlier. A police shows up and you have to flee through the park. I think this part was played as a top down minigame where you had to avoid the cop and escape the park. during the chase you had to avoid the police flashlight and I think you could avoid it by hiding behind bushes.

This same episode also talked about the game 13 or something? Where you get shot and wake up with the number 13 on your chest in roman numerals and you go around killing people in an FPS game? Another section I remember was a star wars game where they told you to activate jedi speed or something like that and run really fast through this area to pull levers and then run through a door because the big monster chasing you, IIRC a Rancor, would get stuck on the door and then you could take your blaster out and kill it without effort.

I don’t remember if it was coins or what but for some reason I feel like they spun and maybe were purple.... Last big thing I remember from this game is that when you got a certain amount of the “coins?” It would take us to another area or level or something.....

There is a bazaar where you pay 20 gems to enter in the starting city, you can haggle with NPCs (they stop haggling after a while), you can mount creatures, and the world map has those green specks (forests) that become hard to pass when your trekking skill is low.

A command-line version still exists but you can only get it from the website. - Angband on Windows doesn't seem to have a CLI build at all.

I love this community. This is going to be SO tough, though... I hope some of you can still help me out. This was surely a pc exclusive, back when there wasn't things like multiplatform and such, we're talking about late 90's most probably. No fancy 3d graphic, the engine was completely bidimensional, but with a good depth of colour and detail, we're probably from 96 to 99/00 i'd say, hope I'm not wrong or this could be very misleading. Genre was strategic, top down graphic, just like command&amp;conquer and such. Setting was modern or a few years ahead. I played the demo, I have no idea about how the full game was. The demo, though, had like a jungle/forest feel, probably some alien jungle? Can't say for sure. The mood and tones were pretty dark anyway, brown and dark green palette. Building structures was not straightforward, I remeber that (even if I had experiences with other strategic titles) it felt pretty complicated. Perhaps it was hard to gather resources (I don't remember any main resources, by the way. Which mean it wasn't something fancy like blue crystals, hallucinating spice or radioactive grass) or maybe it had to be done under specific condition. I couldn't understand english well at the time, so I was probably doing something wrong anyway. I didn't command an army, just a few men and women, nothing like commandos of course. It was still very command &amp; conquer style, no abilities, no stealth mechanic. I can't remember if they were heroes or there was just a limit on units (like 1 per kind for most of them? Maybe just extremely expensive or provided at the beginning?). Character were voiced when selected, unfortunately the only line I can remember was about a female character that said something like ""Info informate?"" (yeah, pronunced like a question), but this may be wrong since, at the time, I couldn't even understand that Cloud and Zack were two different guys while playing Final Fantasy 7. Again, English is not my first language. Yeah, I know this isn't a lot. It's actually close to nothing.

6884,8skn21,tipofmyjoystick,[PC]['10] Difficult sidescrolling shmup in which you fly through an asteroid(?),1,8skn21,1,2018-06-20 20:19:59,oyog,"**Platform(s):** PC **Genre:** sidescrolling shmup **Estimated year of release:** It was a free indie game I downloaded sometime between 2009 to 2011 IIRC **Graphics/art style:** Relatively simple, visually. Higher resolution with a lot of straight lines and almost looked like vector graphics. The floor and ceiling of the tunnel you fly through were gray or brown. I believe the ship you play as was pretty generic sci-fi shmup with sharp angles. **Notable characters:** There was little to no story or exposition and I believe gameplay started as soon as the .EXE was opened. **Notable gameplay mechanics:** Gameplay was very difficult as controlling your ship was more complicated than a game like Gradius or R-Type. I think there was some kind of newtonian physics and I remember being able to control your acceleration. Your fuel was limited and you had to gently scrape the floor or ceiling to collect mass to refuel while you flew and avoided obstacles. I think you might have been able to shoot a simple projectile weapon that also ate up fuel, though I might be misremembering. It's possible there were no enemies in the game. **Other details:** I have a copy of it on my backup HDD which is why it's so damn irritating that I can't remember the name. If it's no longer available online and people have any interest in trying it I would happily upload it somewhere.",1,unsolved,,,

I really don't remember much it was a really long time ago, but I do remember a very specific ability the character had. It was a pink shield of some sort that you could place in front of you and block enemy attacks, it was shaped like a door and with enough upgrades you could place multiple shields. Also in the end, the character wakes up on another planet, a really cold one and could barely walk. The final scene was the player falling down on the snowy ground, out of energy and an alien picking him up and using something to warm him up.

The game is 2d but you can also move up and down, so it gives you a 3d effect. There are many bosses in the game. The first one I remember is a buff guy that has wheels instead of legs and does charge attacks. You can pick up items and find food that heals you. I also remember a mission where you're on a train. There is a barrel shooting mini game in the game that's just for fun, probably for the 2 players to compare, but you can also play it if you're alone. You fight the last boss in a skyscraper, in his office. You enter the skyscraper by crashing in it with an exo suit, I think. The game has many missions. One of them is played in the sewers.

You have to interview basically everybody on board through fairly sophisticated branching dialog trees in order to figure out who you think is the traitor, from what I can remember the game's main selling point was that the traitor was different every time (COULD BE WRONG ABOUT THAT). I never completed it, but from my experience, the entirety of the game seems to take place on the same level and 99% of the gameplay was through dialog trees though you were free to explore almost all of the ship and unlocked doors by getting hints or items from the other NPC's. I remember you could inspect all of the crews rooms and the ship had multiple levels, accessed with stairs from the cargo bay in the rear of the ship or a ladder at the middle and front of the ship. The ship itself was brightly colored, lots of metal greys with yellow pipes and handrails running through the ship. Almost every computer screen (intractable or otherwise) was bright light blue like every computer screen from that era of graphics.

Mechanics of the game: we had just one monster with us but we could phone other monsters we've defeated to come help us in battle. We could also use items to temporarily evolve them during battles (iirc our starter used a satellite dish or antenna to power up). That's about all I remember about the game.

This game had captions, I remember that because that's how my mom taught me how to read were those captions on those games and I kept thinking that she was talking about a ""hush hand"" instead of a husband. I remember some sorta Indiana Jones kinda boulder chasing you and some blonde chick crying over the death of her husband. Or was it the character you were playing as crying over the husband to her blonde friend? And she had brown hair in a bob. I remember that it's not Tomb Raider because Lara's got a braid, this girl didn't. Or it could have been an ambiguous male, I think it was a girl, though. Also there was a pit of spikes and it could impale and kill you at some point? I remember that because I kept fucking falling in it. I'm pretty sure it was Squaresoft because my mom LOVES Square games and most of the games we had for the PS1 were Squaresoft. But I remember there was like a 5 minute video about dinosaurs and it was clearly claymation. I used to watch that like all the freaking time and I don't know if it was a promo to a dinosaur video game or just some random ass video?

I am trying to remember a psone (psx?) game I played years ago but I only have almost a dream like memory of it... It was 3D and featured bright colours I don’t ‘think’ it was in English (maybe Japanese?) Vague memories of a black and white ball-like blob animal creature Environments were blocky (like plastic minecraft) and I think you had to build a little house for your blob thing I don’t think there was a ‘point’ as such to the game, I think there might have been some puzzles to solve It ‘may’ have begun with the letter K ... but that’s a bit of a wild guess Any suggestions welcome.

7165,8srgs9,tipofmyjoystick,Old Mackintosh Platform Game,5,8srgs9,1,2018-06-21 14:30:44,JodieFerguson,"I've been asking around all over the place about an old platform game I used to play as a kid. Thought I'd give it one more shot, using the handy guide I noticed posted at the top. Here goes. **Platform(s):** Mac or PC. I'm about 99&amp;#37; certain it was on a Mac. Either way, it was definitely on a computer, since I didn't have any consoles. **Genre:** Platformer. **Estimated year of release:** Must have been the late 80s or early 90s. **Graphics/art style:** Similar to the graphics style of Jumpman on the C 64. It's not Jumpman, though. I checked. **Notable characters:** A generic character. Wish I could be more descriptive than that, but that's what the character looked like. Just a generic pile of pixels that looked vaguely humanoid. Also, enemies that resembled the enemies in Space Invaders. **Notable gameplay mechanics:** It was a simplistic platformer. Navigate the various platforms, avoid the enemies that just walk back and forth, and collect Pac-Man style pellets. Collect them all, and the stage ends. Also, avoid falling too far, because there was fall damage. No health bar, though. There was also a level editor. If you made a level with one platform and one pellet exactly where the character spawned, he would enter and exit the level in a Möbius loop, until you had to crash the game to make it stop. **Other details:** Various kinds of platforms, including a conveyor belt and fog to slow down your fall. The character walked pretty slowly. I thought it had been part of a Funpack set for the Mac, but I checked and couldn't find the game on any of those sets. It was almost certainly on a floppy disc.",1,,,,

There was one with aliens - it was pretty creepy for me, there were different creatures around the map, you could move up and down on ladders, there were also different rooms - somehow it reminds me of the movie called ""Antz"" The second one is more of a cartoonish one. You started at the bottom of a ship and had to fight your way up to the top - through the kitchen, vents, deck, library(?), other rooms, etc - where you met various enemies which you could hit with a bat. There were moving obstacles too. Feel free to ask for more info, I might remember some other significant details.

7253,8su3ds,tipofmyjoystick,Horror game where serial killer recreates famous paintings with corpses.,14,8su3ds,1,2018-06-21 20:05:10,JaqSmith,"Platform: PC Genre: Horror Year: 2010's? No Earlier than 2000's Graphics: Realistic, 3D rendered, dark, dirty. Third person fixed camera/ side on? Maybe 1st person or some portions may zoom to first to show certain elements (art/ the weapon you are building). Characters: You play as an adult (20-40 yo) woman who is captured by a serial killer. He is possibly a doctor of some kind and may wear a surgical mask. I only remember those two characters being present in the game and for some reason I can't seem to picture either of them. Setting: Present day, serial killer's murder basement. The map consists of several rooms. Some of them include a cooler-like room where you wake up, a room or rooms full of human dioramas, a tool room/ workshop and the man's kill room where he works on corpses. Possibly with a dentist's style chair under a bright light in the center. I think the exit is on the far side of this room. Gameplay: You wake up in a serial killer's basement. You discover that he is posing his victim's bodies to recreate famous paintings. For some reason you have to find the missing element to some of these dioramas to finish the picture. For example: adding an earring to *Girl with a Pearl Earring*. You must sneak around through several connected rooms without attracting the killer's attention, completing puzzles and building a weapon. I believe there were multiple variations of the weapon you could build. One was a circular sawblade on a stick or pipe. The killer spends most of his time in his kill room. I think you have to fight your way past him to escape. Other: I believe I watched a YouTuber play this but I can't remember which one and my husband has no memory of it. For some reason I'm getting the memory confused with The Cat Lady, and the Heavy Rain DLC, so It's especially hard to pick apart. It did seem very much like a segment from Cat Lady and possibly a similar length but I believe the art was 3D rendered.

There was one with aliens - it was pretty creepy for me, there were different creatures around the map, you could move up and down on ladders, there were also different rooms - somehow it reminds me of the movie called ""Antz"". There was a character - maybe yours actually - which said something like ""Zoe"" in a strange alien voice. The other one is more of a cartoon. You started at the bottom of a ship and had to fight your way up to the top - through the kitchen, vents, deck, library(?), other rooms, etc - where you met various enemies which you could hit with a bat. There were moving obstacles too. Feel free to ask for more info, I might remember some other significant details.

And to get to the next level you walk through the whole screen from left to right in a tunnel your height to another door that leads you to the next level.
