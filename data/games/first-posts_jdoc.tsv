8qyjz0	game	jdoc-annotated	reddit	Upcoming Post-Apocalyptic Beat em' Up Indie Game Focused on Energy Conservation. Platform(s): PC but probably console online marketplaces too Genre: Beat-em up (Double Dragon, Streets of Rage, TMNT, X-Men arcade games) Estimated year of release: Soonish? Graphics/art style:Pixel art Notable characters: Main character is heavily wrapped in rags and trained in some martial art where he can make as few movements as possible to conserve energy. Notable gameplay mechanics: The big pull was the energy conservation mechanic. Every step you take drains your energy bar and it's best to defeat your enemies in as few movements as possible. Enemies are bound by this mechanic as well allowing players to tire bandits out to defeat them easier. Other details:It was shown off in a gameranx video as a best of some conference list (maybe Gamescom?) Any help would be really appreciated. Thanks a bunch!
8reusq	game	jdoc-annotated	reddit	[Likely some Nintendo system][Likely post-2000] Origin of this edited screenshot?.

8o1eod	game	jdoc-annotated	reddit	Puzzle game with round robot. I'm looking for the name of a relatively recent puzzle game (within the last 6-7 years). You control a simple round white robot, like just a ball with a photo lens representing an eye. The puzzles have you manipulating cubes of matter, like putting a sand cube in front of a laser to turn it into a glass cube. I remember you collect some golden...puzzle pieces or photo pieces (gets kinda foggy when I go into that much detail). Does anyone here know what the game might be?

It was a lovely game, with no negativity in the game at all. I think the main objective was to win over another character with kindness
8owo2k	game	jdoc-annotated	reddit	Game with a level where all the people got turned to dust and you have to carefully walk through the level to not disturb the graves.. I remember this being one of the Gears Of War games, but no amount of googling pointed me to which one, then I thought it could have been Spec Ops: The Line or Resident Evil 5, as those are all third person shooters i played around the same time. I was super sure this was a thing in Gears Of War 1 like an hour ago, then I went looking to make sure it was in 1 and not 2, and now I'm not even sure it was from that series. Adding to this is the fact that I played through the first 3 Gears games for the first time in one weekend the Christmas break after 3 came out. I really thought that was a super poignant moment, and now I can't even remember what game it was in.

Thanks to anyone who can help
8sodzb	game	jdoc-annotated	reddit	[PC] Life simulation game in which you're born as a random person in the world. I played this game about 5-8 years ago. It was a PC game, I think it was played online on a website but I can't remember for sure, it may have been a download. From what I can remember, on the start you were born as a random human. You could be male or female, be born with a genetic defect, or whatever. If you were born female in a country like Saudi Arabia, it would give you a message saying that you can't vote or work and have few rights. If the country was low in development, you were likely to die as a baby from sickness or starve to death, and it was more difficult to make a good life. You were more likely to be born in populous countries like China, and very unlikely to be born in low population countries. After that you made different decisions on how you wanted to live your life. Your character had different stats like intelligence which determined how successful they could be, like if you could go to a university and become a doctor. You had relationship stats with your family members, and I think there was even a basic romance system where you could have a partner, get married, and have kids. I remember you could be arrested and killed for political activism. The interface mostly consisted of looking at a map of the world and reading pop ups about news and your life, and I think there was a separate interface screen to look at your stats and view things like your family members. The graphics of the game were extremely basic, mostly consisting of numbers and a map, and I think maybe some very basic ugly models for characters.

8qpzu6	game	jdoc-annotated	reddit	[PC]The platformer game about a boy made of graffiti drawings. Hey guys, i forgot the year it's out, unfortunately, but i do remember it was at least on PC. This is what i also remember : - It's a platformer, jump and shoot, there is a boss at the end of a set of levels. - The settings of the game is at some urban city area, with hiphop music most of the time. - The character is actually a graffiti drawings, he is always sticked on a wall. He jumps and shoots other monster also made from graffiti drawings. I can't say if it's 2d or 3D platformer, because all of the time the character is sticked to the wall but sometimes camera changes as player jumps from one wall to another. Thanks for reading guys i hope i can find this game again
8rrn13	game	jdoc-annotated	reddit	[PC] [~2005-2008] Extremely negatively received Painkiller-esque game developed in Eastern Europe. This game has been reviewed by IGN and was given a score of 2.0 or lower. I also distinctly remember a dodo-like enemy being featured in the screenshots of IGN's written review — if there's no IGN review with a bird, your looking at a wrong game. I'm fairly certain that the development studio was located in Moscow and the title was abstract, something like ""We Last Few"" (not necessarily close, only an example). I haven't seen gameplay footage, the Painkiller connection has been made either in the reviews or by the developer.
8oziiy	game	jdoc-annotated	reddit	Game Boy Advenure Game. **Platform(s):** Classic Gameboy **Genre:** (Fantasy) Adventure with RPG aspects (iirc) **Estimated year of release:** Played it way back between 95 and 2000, I want to say. **Graphics/art style:** As far as I remember you had your adventurer in the lower middle of the screen. You were able to advance one screen to the left, the right or upwards and often you had the choice between multiple of those. Often you had to fight enemies that were placed in front of your character. **Notable characters:** Don't remember. **Notable gameplay mechanics:** I know it had a password save system. When you wanted to stop you could use a menu item and it would show a alphanumerical password. When you wanted to continue your game, you had the option to load one of those states. **Other details:** I played it in my childhood in Germany. I can't remember whether it was German or English, but it was definitely released in the PAL region. I think I remember that you started your adventure into a forest. I am really lost and would love to see whether it is just nostalgica or whether this game was really any good.
8p6ffw	game	jdoc-annotated	reddit	Whats the name of this game. I don't remember the name of it but it was a point and click adventure game. What I remember is that you play as a scientist, a black detective and a nurse with trouble pass with her parents. I also remember you are looking for this weapon that will destroy whatever in the center of the 2 devices. I think it was an Adam collider or something like that. the last thing I remember, Spoilers: is that the scientist you play at the start turns out to be the culprit and was stalking the nurse. then took her on top of a tower and tries to kill her.

Ship upgrades like guns etc.. wanna say you could encounter aliens Other: I know this is terribly vague considering it sums up 90% of all space games, but it's been a very long time since I played it. I remember it having 3 panels one on left,bottom, and right with main screen in between them. Been trying to remember it for the past 2 years but my memory is shot. I could however pick it out from a screenshot I'm positive.

Idk if anybody who remembers this game may have had this problem, but I remember that the back of the box listed the game as a 2 player game, but there wasn't a menu option for 2 players anywhere.
8otohd	game	jdoc-annotated	reddit	[PC][1990ish]oldish pc adventure/point and click game. **Platform(s):** PC, non other that i know off **Genre:** adventure point and click, it was detective based FBI i believe. **Estimated year of release:** 1990ish or late 80's **Graphics/art style:** same quality of graphics as vampire masquerades **Notable characters:** you play two different detectives one works as a forensic investigator the other one interacts with people at the scene. **Notable game play mechanics:** you can change between the man and woman detectives in order to unlock new crime scene evidence, in order to do this you have to interact with your partner, then you play them and find more evidence, until you go back to your partner. **Other details:** **spoiler** i got as far as going back to the police station with the fella alone then had to go to a crime scene i had made with his partner by having played her previously. 'I think' my memory is a little fuzzy. but this is the style of game play that develops throughout the game. there are multiple endings if i recollect. The game is considered uniquely special for its age and ingenuity and has stood fairly well as a popular and highly rated game even by today's standards. - i just cant remember the name or find it on the net.

8rsj4a	game	jdoc-annotated	reddit	NES Medieval Puzzel Side-scroller. This is killing me right now.... This game was an unlicensed cartridge and kind of looked like Gouls n Ghosts / Ghosts n Gobblins. It was a medieval side scrolling puzzel game and I think somehow fairies and or naked-lady statues played into it. I believe you were collecting them. Also, you couldn't jump and had to collect things / do things in a certain order or else you could get trapped and had to wait for the timer to countdown. It totally wasn't Solomon's Key. I think the name had Death or Dark or Lord in the title but all combinations of those words have not helped me find this game. BTW - this game wasn't awesome or anything (graphics were pretty good!), It was more frustrating than anything but it popped into my head last night (high AF) and now I can't shake it!!
8op2p6	game	jdoc-annotated	reddit	[PC][2000-ish]A Puzzle game in which you use a scientist. The story, if i remembered correctly, is about a scientist who creates robots(?), but it kinda back fired, and now he have to complete puzzles to stop the robots. it have a cartoony style, the scientist looks like einstein in a lab coat. the game is a 2d puzzle platformer, the levels are just solving puzzles to open the portal to the next level. we can move around boxes to put it on a red button (the button is on the floor) also there's a solve level option in the main menu, where if you click it, it will show you how to finish the puzzle on the said level. sorry my memory is kinda hazy on this game, and this is the only thing i remember
8qe2py	game	jdoc-annotated	reddit	[PC][2000]2D platformer in a fantasy world. Platforms: PC Genre: 2D platformer Estimated year of release: between 1998-2005 Graphics/art style: It is in 2D anime cartoon style. The worlds were mostly bright colored. I remember a level on a pirate ship, you would jump across the ship defeating pirates. There is also a level where you have to climb up a giant green bean stalk. Notable characters: I distincly remember the story went like this. A human boy woke up at night to an elf like boy with (I think) green hair to help save his fantasy world. They sort of fuse and I thought one of the characters name was Coco. Notable gameplay mechanics: as the fusion boy who saves the world you had to defeat enemies. I remember this could be done by shooting fireballs out of your hands. You could also do a kick on the ground. When jumping and kicking you could infinitly jump around doing roundhouse kicks. If you would also press the command to shoot fireballs, it would causd you to jump while roundhousing while also shooting fireballs. Other details: In the pirate ship level there was a girl in the background you could somehow interact with and receive a kiss from. I'm not sure but I think the Icon of the game on my desktop looked like a pineapple. There was a way using cheat codes to unlock al the different levels. Iirc there were around 5 or 7. Thank you very much, I would love to see this piece of nostalgia again!

Again you never leave your truck and you can also make combos same way as morning. When you enough money you can buy more lands to produce more products. For example you start with a wheat field.

When you buy your bakery you can use flour to produce breads and etc. to sell town's cafe. This is a top down game. You look from sky to ground.

8q2sw0	game	jdoc-annotated	reddit	[PC?][~2000] A angelic / deity themed first person game. **Platform(s):** 90% sure it was PC **Genre:** First person...rpg? I don't want to say shooter because there wasn't much shooting involved, maybe some slashing? **Estimated year of release:** Late 90s. **Graphics/art style:** It had a sinister atmosphere. The game was in 3D. **Notable characters:** I sadly don't recall any. I think the main character is some angelic thing. **Notable gameplay mechanics:** **Other details:** What I remember most vividly was a specific level / stage where you'd walk though a hallway that felt... organic. It was like walking through a bloody pulsating gut, but that's mostly my only impression of the game. I vaguely remember that the walking along a hallway was a very repetitive theme.

There was a free trial version and you could pay a small fee to unlock the full thing. You could play with other people on the same keyboard, using WASD or Arrow Keys. **Other details:**It wasn't on any particular gaming platform but just its own website. I think a few youtubers played it way back when.

8sdb0u	game	jdoc-annotated	reddit	A PC shooter I used to watch my dad playing as a kid. Platforms: PC Genre: First Person Shooter Estimated Year of Release: 1999-2003 Graphics/Art Style: Possibly 64 bit, futuristic or industrial setting Notable Characters: Big mech/robot enemies Notable Gameplay Mechanics: Stopping said mechs by using a computer Other Details: I originally posted this on r/HelpMeFind and was told this may be a better place to ask. My details on this one are blurry. As a kid I remember watching my dad play a lot of games on his PC but one always sticks out because it always interested me. What I remember is that it was a first person shooter. I don't remember what enemies there were except one - a giant mech. I don't remember how big it was exactly but I remember that it was very slow. It took its steps very slowly as it tried to go after you. One detail that I feel very certain and yet also cautious of was how it was beaten. There were green computers and when you used them the mech was stopped. It either shut down or blew up, I can't remember, but this is the detail that sticks in my mind the most because I specifically remember being in the playground with my friends and essentially role-playing this game and I definitely made them go to a green computer to defeat a giant robot. I don't know how much of that is accurate but it sticks out in my mind. There are a few other details floating around. I think one of the green computers was on top of something you had to climb up (maybe a stack of barrels or crates) and the mech was chasing you through a corridor out into a small, open area outside where the computer was. And this may have been from a different game but I think I remember a lizard-y alien thing in some sort of water area. As for the time, I must have between 2 and 6 years old when I saw it. That would have put it anywhere between 1999 and 2003. I don't remember the graphics, I am inclined to say 64 bit but I don't know. I have tried to explain as best as possible with the vague details I have in my head. Any help would be great!

8qspqq	game	jdoc-annotated	reddit	Repost [PC][90s] Anti stealing/drug/gang game.. I’m listing OP’s description of the game here because it’s much more thorough than the details I remember but I know for a fact it’s the game I’m looking for: I remember playing this game in the mid-90s on the PC that was incredibly blunt with it's messages against drugs, gangs and theft. It was a cartoon style. There were three characters and each one represented each different problem. My memory is hazy, but I think I recall the drug guy being tall and maybe red (I remember that if you win, he quits drugs and becomes a pole vaulter), the gang guy was big, blue and violent and the thief was a green woman. I remember that in order to win, you had to collect pieces of each of the character's mind and put it together for them so they could come to their senses and quit breaking the law and being a bad citizen. I never had time to get the minds of the gang guy and shoplifter. I only remember one specific scene in the game, it was with the drug user and he was showing the kids in the game how to sniff airplane glue out of a paper bag. The whole game barely pulled punches with showing the guy strung out and jonesing. That's all I can remember, the gameplay was mainly watching scenes of bad stuff, and why it's bad and shouldn't do it. I remember one mini game where it teaches you about gang colors, and you shouldn't wear gang colors, and it consisted of a choosing a color not related to a gang.

Had to enter the command before Windows booted up and I recall always having to think about the spelling in the command because it wasn't quite the correct spelling for the word. Graphics were cartoony and all shades of tan and brown like caves and rocks, the title looked like it was carved from stone, I think you controlled the main character but you could view your own character (not first person, sort of like Super Mario Bros 3 on NES) and maybe climbed upward during the game. So long ago that is basically all I can recall...

8otksz	game	jdoc-annotated	reddit	[PC] Educational point and click Game about rescuing robots to fix time. I remember playing a game in school back in 2008 or earlier in which the main character's younger sister messes with a time machine to literally make herself the center of the universe, and you must collect robots to travel through time to fix her schenanigans. I believe it takes place in a large castle or mansion, and each floor you go to has an educational mini game or two to beat before advancing. Once you clear the final floor, you obtain one robot, and must repeat the steps to gain the rest, or something like that. This was years ago and we played it in a computer lab in school when 3rd grade or lower around 2008 at the latest, so it must have been developed before that time and be made for a third grade learning level

8rajnp	game	jdoc-annotated	reddit	[C64][1984]1 or 2 player plane game where you bombed boats and islands.. Commodore64 ~1984 Side view plane flying game, where you could shoot bullets out of the front of the plane, and drop bombs down. The screen would be static and did not scroll. You would wrap around and appear on the other side of the screen instead. You could play as 1 or 2 players, and it was a lot easier with 2 players. The point of the game was to shoot a hole through a boat using bombs. When you dropped a bomb, it would remove a ""square"" from the boat. Other AI planes flew around shooting at you. I remember multiple levels, one level being a boat, one level being an island.
8osvsx	game	jdoc-annotated	reddit	[Android][Choose Your Own Adventure] Game where you fight a nigh-omnipotent wizard.. Hey. I'm sorry for this being very vague, but I'd really appreciate it if anyone could help me. Anyway, the game that I'm looking for was a text-based Choose Your Own Adventure game. It had a fantasy medieval setting and you were a person who wanted to be a wizard (or were pretending to be one). At critical points of the game's story, you would go through a skill check, which would compare your stats (that you could upgrade) with a number and your stata were higher, you would pass. Now, one thing I remember was the the description of one the wizards you encounter. Basically, he was all-powerful, being able to destroy a city with a thought. Also, you joined up with a party during your travels. I know this isn't much to go on, but I do not underestimate the power of this sub.

8nxcqt	game	jdoc-annotated	reddit	Looking for an aliens inspired multiplayer game.. Looking for a multiplayer FPS that I’m pretty certain was on the PC. Genre: First person shooter Platform: 90 percent certain it was on the PC Estimated year of release: 2010s Graphics: the game was dark, full of metal corridors: likely taking place in a space station. This may be my mind inserting things into blank spaces, but I think I remember players having lights on their suits. Notable gameplay mechanics: The game was multiplayer, and you would be completing a mission on a space station/vessel infested by aliens. The aliens could burst through walls, and you could seal doors to hold them off. If I remember correctly, if you died, you respawned as a new individual, but I could very easily be wrong.

Maybe on others but remember playing this on Windows 95 **Genre:** I suppose it would be classed as RPG, 3rd person **Estimated year of release:** Anywhere in the 90's is by best guess, I played it on a P166 machine which according to Wikipedia would be around 1995 **Graphics/art style:** The graphics were 3d but quite rounded from what I remember. For example, arms and legs looked like the were made up of 3d oval shapes **Notable characters:** The main character was male and enemies were green goblin/troll looking creatures. Also features spiders which were quite large in comparison to the player **Notable gameplay mechanics:** Health was regenerated with potions I think **Other details:** The game started with the playable character in wooden stocks in a courtyard in what I think was a castle. A bolt of lightning hits the character and a voice speaks to them (think it was a womans voice in a British accent?) The player is then freed from the stocks by the lightning and the game starts. There were gargoyle type heads in walls that you hit with a sword to open doors or get hints (I think). I have searched high and low and can't seem to find the name of this game so any help is appreciated!!!!
8rim24	game	jdoc-annotated	reddit	[PC][2012-2014?]First-Person Puzzle Hacking game. **Platform(s):** PC **Genre:** First-Person, Puzzle, Atmospheric **Estimated year of release:** 2012-2014? Was unreleased at the time **Graphics/art style:** Command terminals, black &amp; white 3D environments, glitchy visuals **Notable characters:** None **Notable gameplay mechanics:** The intro of the game required the player to enter commands into a command terminal in order to enter the game. The 3D portion required the player to position themselves in specific spots in the world and view glitched structures from certain angles in order to reconstruct them. **Other details:** From what I recall, the game's title was an acronym. The whole concept was something along the lines of having to connect to a server/computer and virtually enter it, repairing broken pieces of it as mentionned in mechanics in order to fix the corruption/glitches. The last time I saw it, it was in heavy development and no longer downloadable (this was something around the year I've mentionned). The intro of the game was a puzzle in itself, requiring the player to figure out various commands to prepare a connection to the virtual world via a command terminal. Upon figuring it out, it'd slowly power up with fancy visuals and sound effects before putting the player into a 3D world in first-person.

Poles and mattress when turning left and right for boost. Use L2/R2 (or L1/R1, I forgot) to extend hand to grab the poles or hit the mattress. 3. Vaulting over walls, among other things for shortcuts. 4. (Maybe?) Character can slide too. 5. Castle as the final race track vs. the princess 6. A Japanese forest as one of the track vs. the Kappa creature. 7. Even though it's single player, the race will do a split screen from time to time to see where your opponent is. **Other details:** 1. It's not Running High. I checked and it's not it. 2. [Post-submit] The Japan-Exclusive thing is not 100% sure, but the game was in Japanese when I played it so I assumed it's a Japan-only game.

8om3w8	game	jdoc-annotated	reddit	[PS2/360] [2000-2010] Tactical Rpg involving being a Mercenary helping various Nations fight eachother in the form of side missions to move the plot. Platform(s): ps2, possibly 360 (owned both at the time) Genre: Tactical Rpg, set characters as party Estimated year of release: 2000ish, seemed like one of those late game ps2 era rpgs Graphics/art style: hand drawn art for portraits, chibi 3d avatars made popular by final fantasy tactics and Disgaea. The maps follow a similar pattern, being block based for distance and levels for platforms. Notable characters: I remember there being at least 5 factions, each with a handful of characters each. There was a Catholic/noble knight faction you start working with for the first mission, with a robed old man as the Leader. There was an Underworld geoup, with a bare chested animalistic man and a big chested woman as it's leaders. There was an eastern empire with multiple young girls as its generals. There was a Elven nation, which if I remember correctly had a mage with a floppy bunny ear hat with a crucifix shaped staff. There was also an evil empire, with a vampire looking dude that looked like a castlevania rip off. For the main party I remember there being two male heroes, a blond and a brunette both in standard boring armor. There was also a female sidekick healer. The only Unique character I remember that wasn't from a conquered nation was a tan girl raised by goblins, with a studded club as a weapons and the verbal tick ""Gobli Gobli"". I didn't beat the game, but it seemed like the main villain was a giant flaming demon monster that was possessing a child. I remember the reveal mission had them find Tue child in a burning village, and he started crying until he exploded into a demon form that was invincible. Notable gameplay mechanics: There was a big focus on having a normal sized party against many enemy units. Most of the non main mission quests were set types of jobs to help one nation attack another nation. Like ""cut off supplies"" or ""capture enemy general"". On the fields there were glowing runes that had different effects, and were the main way to gain the advantage in a fight. I also remember you could explode the runes to cause other runes to change effects in some way. Beyond that it honestly played mostly like a squaresoft tactical dog with equip item slots and generic skills and magic. Other details: mainly I remember that the game was a sequel, either 2 or 3 in the series. I also remember the board was a brownish red background with the main heroes overlapping into a L shape, like how a lot of dog titles used to show character faces. It had a really artsy but forgettable name, like resonance of fate or infinite undiscovery. But my memory is vague so that may be wrong

Might aim archers. No scrolling, as far as I can recall. **Other details:** If you throw one stickman in the air and they fall down, there's blood animations like they spatter around and turn flat. It's around a castle with green grass. There is a power up system, or not-I don't remember. There could be ones that fly or something, but I do remember giant stickmen.

8oxh9i	game	jdoc-annotated	reddit	[PS1] [Late 90's] Dnd Style Fantasy RPG. When I was younger, and we just moved into some new apartment, my upstairs neighbor gave me a PS1 game he had. It was immediately different cus rather than being in a normal CD case, it was in some sort of black, rectangular box that was way too tall for just the single disc it strored, but this box seemed to have the right art to the game inside it. From what I can remember of the actual game is that it was a top\-down European Fantasy RPG. I think it was more of an RTS than turn based, and had Zelda\-like screen tracking from one area to the next. I'd say you can rule out any JRPG, since this was definitely more of a DnD\-esque adventure.

8ouz03	game	jdoc-annotated	reddit	Sega Master System Game (1995ish but could be earlier/later) help please. So I used to play this game on the sega when I was young, born in 1987 so I’m guessing 1995 I would of been around seven or eight. You played a young girl with blonde hair and I think a red dress. It was a haunted house platformer. The first level I remember you had to go through this grey hallway and haunted knights would come out of the walls. You had no weapons that I remember, you had to aim your cursor to interact with objects as she walked along. The next level you had a grand dining room kinda, and windows would break and paintings fly off the walls to try and hit your character and you had to click on them to help her. And when she died she would just flop on the ground this pile of blonde hair. Anyway if anyone remembers this it would be sooo cool. Been trying to remember for years and just found out this sub Reddit exists

You could pick up NES cartridges and insert them into a virtual NES which you would then play on the in-game TV screen. There were other consoles you could play. I’m pretty sure there was a Game Boy which you would hold in first person and play. Other details: If I remember correctly, you could load your own ROMs into the game and play them. It was essentially an emulator built into a virtual 3D space.

Once entered you had to cross a bridge while being attacked by a big bird.

There is always a chance I have gotten several games jumbled in my head, but here goes. I believe this game was a demo or beta and that it was timed. I believe you are hunting something through a forest, tracking something. I remember having to crawl through a fallen log. Eventually you get to where the whatever battle is, and the battle was pretty much geared towards needing to shoot environmental hazards (I believe it was explosive barrels) to kill the enemy. I am sorry, but I do not remember if it was third or first person. Thanks in advance, guys.
8sljoz	game	jdoc-annotated	reddit	Windows game ~1997. I bought this game back in 1997, it was one of those quasi-realtime strategy games that ran on Windows.

The ""tutorial"" was the character who hired you telling you what to do with a really redneck twist, and at some point you could even spy on and blackmail him, at which point he'd pay up, say ""you stink"" and stop giving you help/hints. I know, I know, really vague ... But I'm trying to remember the title.

It could be as old as 20 years, and I'm feeling like it was from a PC game. I was young then so it was probably targeted at a young audience. It's not a main theme, it seems like it was some menu song or a very common one during slow parts of the game. If it helps, the real one sounded more steel drum-ish and higher pitched that the virtual piano I used to replicate it.

8r5ilt	game	jdoc-annotated	reddit	[PC] [2010-2014] Puzzle game with delivery trucks. **Platform(s): PC** **Genre: Puzzle game** **Estimated year of release: 2010-2014** **Graphics/art style:** This game had an isometric view with simple but nice looking graphics. I would give Polybridge as an sort of example of graphical style. **Notable characters:** **Notable gameplay mechanics:** There were multiple trucks on the map and the objective was to plot out a path they take through the map to their destination so that they don't crash into each other. So you would pick a route for every truck and then click the ''play'' button and see what happens. **Other details:** Sometimes the trucks would have to pick up something on the map to deliver to a specific house, and they would have different colors, so only a yellow truck can deliver stuff to the yellow house etc.
8pvuda	game	jdoc-annotated	reddit	[ps1 or ps2][dont know year]demo for a hoverboarding game like tony hawk. **Platform(s):** ps1 or ps2 but most likely ps2 **Genre:** Sports **Estimated year of release:** **Graphics/art style:** I think they were meant to be realistic at the time **Notable characters:** a skateboarding guy and a woman talking through comms **Notable gameplay mechanics:** it was like tony hawk but i believe it was a open world game but i have poor memories of it, while i'm sure it was set in the future this ""hoverboard"" tech was described as a prototype by the female character. the demo was i think 20 minutes long which was enforced by a timer and at the end the female would complain to me that ""you ... blew everything"" in an angry voice despite having no clear goal other than racking up points and causing general mischief. one notable objective was to destroy security camaras **Other details:** i was so young at the time and my brain hadn't even comprehended that if you liked a demo you should get the game, it looked interesting but i hardly remember anything else about it

8nyi28	game	jdoc-annotated	reddit	(Pc) old flash torture game. Idk the site or anything other than it was a flash game, probably round 2006 ish and you could kill the guy in a variety of ways, from changing the gravity to crush him, and turning up the heat to burn him out, to skinning him alive with a razor and the muscle would show up underneath.
8smhbp	game	jdoc-annotated	reddit	Dying to remember. Ok so this has been driving me crazy for years, hopefully someone here can help. I remember playing an old side-scrolling game when I was a kid in which you play as three or four different people in a “party” or whatever you want to call it, one of the characters was a mole person or something with goggles and I think a robot hand or something (sounds nuts I know XD) maybe not a mole person, maybe just short and fat...well either way, short and fat. Lol I don’t remember anything else about him other than him wearing a brown shirt or coat or something. If I remember correctly, his special ability was that he can dig through certain parts of the area, a tomb or something if I remember correctly. One of the other characters was a bigger guy, buff I think, naturally he was the powerhouse that could move heavy things. Another was a shorter character, maybe a kid or something, skinny if I remember right. I don’t remember the other character, but for some reason I keep thinking of Disney when I try to remember. Pretty sure i played it on the gameboy advance, but for some reason it also makes me think of the ps2, but I’m pretty sure it was a handheld game. I think it resembled the hell out of the secret side scrolling level in prince of Persia sands of time, same or similar 3d design and whatnot, same idea. If anyone here can help me out, I’d extremely appreciate it. I know that info is a bit vague, but that’s all I got. Thanks in advance. :D
8oypgf	game	jdoc-annotated	reddit	I'm looking for a game i played in 2014-2015 (not sure if that is the year when it is made).

The map was seen from above.
8p4ffq	game	jdoc-annotated	reddit	[PC Windows][2010-2016] A dueling game where you could control your characters limbs to create unique moves every second.. **Platform(s):** Windows (Could be on Steam) **Genre:** I don't know what it classifies as, maybe fighting, brawling **Estimated year of release:** Really not sure but I think I played it at around 2014 **Graphics/art style:** Really simple graphics, player models are made up with little sphere shaped blocks. There is a floor(like in dojos) Background is empty if I remember correctly **Notable characters:** None. It was multiplayer oriented. **Notable gameplay mechanics:** It was very unique. Every second or so your character would stop. Then you would click the parts of the body you wanted to make a move. For example if i twisted my ankles downwards my character would stand on its fingers(at least for a few seconds :D) **Other details:** It could be played online and there were also custom maps. But by default it was a 1v1 fighting game but you controlled every part of the body before setting your character on motion. I think it had a client seperate from steam but it still could be on steam. Sorry for scarce details. And really sorry for bad grammar.
8o6lwj	game	jdoc-annotated	reddit	[PS1] Very similar to Tenchu but with a samurai instead of a ninja. Can't remember the name.. I remember playing a game that was very similar to Tenchu but with samurai instead of ninjas. It was with a third person perspective and very bloody but not gory. The menu options had Japanese wooden block sounds. And it felt like a prototype Way of the Samurai. It was for the PS1 and the main character wore white I think. Anyone know this game?
8rkuky	game	jdoc-annotated	reddit	[C64][Mid-80's] Looking for a weird one-screen game that had a creature with some kind of vacuum on his nose/trunk.. I have vague memory of this game but I'm pretty sure it wasn't commercially well known. You move on screen with a Pac-Man like creature that has a long trunk (instead of a mouth), which acts like a vacuum cleaner. You were supposed to collect some things with the vacuum and some monsters you could 'eat' with it. Otherwise you needed to avoid contact with them. Game doesn't scroll in any direction, everything happens in one screen.

8q30cp	game	jdoc-annotated	reddit	[PC][~2014]Looks a lot like Underworld Ascendant. [https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=shehnIrfq7k](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=shehnIrfq7k) Looks a lot like that game but was obviously released already by 2014/2015. It's super fun and has smooth gameplay, and you have to clear all enemies inside a temple that has several rooms. The name of the game starts with a Z, I think, but I could be wrong. It definitely has the letter Z in it. You mostly cast spells to defeat enemies. That is all I remember. Please help me find this game again.
8rebs9	game	jdoc-annotated	reddit	[PC][Mid 90s]Horror game set in toy store. I have very vague memories of a game I played as a child. I don't remember any particularly scary parts, but I think my mom/sister may have screened which parts they thought would be too much for me. The game was set in a toy store. You were apparently locked inside and trying to escape. I think the toys were coming to life. **Platform(s):** PC, possibly a DOS game but I don't think it was **Genre:** Horror, fixed perspective third person. **Estimated year of release:** 1993? **Graphics/art style:** Polygonal characters set against still backgrounds. Camera was fixed; you could move around in a scene, and scene would change if you moved into a different area, a la the classic *King's Quest* games **Notable characters:** Main character resembled a garden gnome? Was either a woman or a child, possibly both. It also featured a Jack-in-the-box very early in the game that I think was sentient, maybe the villain **Notable gameplay mechanics:** Honestly can't remember much of anything about the gameplay other than the character being difficult to control because of the camera perspective. I believe it had an inventory system like old point and click adventure games (I don't think this game was P&amp;C to control though) I'm not sure if this was a demo or something because I don't think it was a very big game.

I remember the visuals being slightly distorted **Notable characters:** A robot that you control **Notable gameplay mechanics:** You collect robot parts and there was a button to shoot. **Other details:** I remember it being fairly melancholic with some connections and parallels to child abuse.
8rr6ps	game	jdoc-annotated	reddit	[PS2?][Early 2000s] Big open battle, swords, archers and you can ride horses. I played it on a PS2 I think, it was a fighting game where at the start you pick one of four characters, If it helps I believe there was a really big guy, and then three other smaller characters. In the actual game there is a huge battle going on, swords and archers, and there are battlements or a castle, not sure which, and then after you fought enough people, a cut scene would play, I think, where some guy made a load of rocks fall down blocking you. I think you could ride horses during the battle as well.
8re1oq	game	jdoc-annotated	reddit	[PC] [mid 80s - early 90s] Goldstone/goldburg? monster shooting game. **Platform:** PC **Genre:** Point and click-to-shoot **Estimated year of release:** 82-92 **Graphics/art style:** 8-bit? (pixelated like [this](https://media.indiedb.com/cache/images/games/1/35/34418/thumb_620x2000/lechuck_boss.png)) **Notable characters:** Various monsters with gun-type weapons **Notable gameplay mechanics:** Using food inside vending machines to increase health. There may have been coins released after a successful monster shot. **Other details:** I think the name of the game was *Gold-something*. I'd have to go into some sort of lab and kill all the monsters. There were various types of monsters, but the most common one was a tall, brown, hunched thing (if you know Gossamer from Looney tunes, that's the shape). I think this was in one of those old school computers, so it was either pre-Windows or a very early version of it.
8se242	game	jdoc-annotated	reddit	Off Brand Cartoon Style Racing Game PS1 or PS2. **Platform(s): PS1 Or PS2** **Genre: Racing** **Estimated year of release: Around 2002** **Graphics/art style: Cartoony** **Notable characters: N/A** **Notable gameplay mechanics: Kart style racing** **Other details:** It was this weird racing game much like Mario Kart. I remember the biggest thing I remembered as a nine year old is that in the opening cut scene before the menu opened a camera flew around and looked at different tracks and characters but what I remember the most was they went in one of the female racers bathrooms while she was showering and the camera person was quickly shooed away. I remember a level that took place at a casino, and that's about it.
8sfm32	game	jdoc-annotated	reddit	[PC/Mac?][90s]Point and click adventure game about a train race. Platform: I think it was on Mac, but I could be wrong. I forget what we had at the time. Genre: Point and click adventre Era: Maybe the 90s? I remember playing it around the same time that I played Putt Putt, Math Blaster, Spy Fox, Freddy Fish, etc. Graphics/art style: Nothing particular to note. Just cartoony. Notable characters: A girl and a cat, both train conductors racing their respective trains. The cat was a bit of a tool from what I remember. Other details: There was a spooky forest towards the end where the douche bag cat got stuck. Had this freaky bird that when you clicked on it made this sound that I can still picture today.

I'm listing several systems because I played it on one of those cheap European NES/Sega consoles that could run all sorts of cartridges. Basically, you'd play as a guy with an axe, fight all sorts of monsters and bosses, and was somewhat similar to Castlevania or Ghosts and Goblins. All I remember is that you could upgrade or use other axes, and that the jumping animation was very distinct, you would jump with your head looking up. Thanks!
8p75cm	game	jdoc-annotated	reddit	Odd Mario Game. When I was young I remember playing a Mario game that had the 8 bit style but the only things I remember about it was you could play as Mario with different color schemes. Also I am almost 100% sure that it was not a official game released by Nintendo so more than likely it was a flash game. One last side note is I think it was multiplayer and I distinctly remember playing as a blue Mario.

It looked like Limbo but with fighting with swords. It looks really similar to a game called Gloom too but that isn't it. **Notable characters:** You control a black silhouette. **Notable gameplay mechanics:** Idk **Other details:** I don't know why I can't find this game anymore. It was really new but it's gone from steam or I'm blind. I originally saw it in the popular new releases section around the same time as Moonlighter.

I remember there being some clown-themed levels or dungeons. You would earn money depending if you were able to finish objectives, if I remember, but I might mix it with another game. Graphics were good, but not extremely realistic. Any idea which game I'm referring to? Thanks
8pbrr8	game	jdoc-annotated	reddit	I really want to remember this one. Ok, so it starts with a cutscene inside a plane or something, there are some few characters. Among them was someone who looks like a professor, I remember him drinking from a mug and then spitting the drink suddenly (lol i know I am being weird). Anyway, the game starts when the player jumps out of this plane, spaceship, while using a parachute, to land inside a building in which there was that weird fatass monster who's holding something similar to a popsicle? I remember the main character to have a cone\-like head / helmet, and a black custom or armor.

I've been searching for it everywhere, but I can't seem to ""tie"" any ""keywords"" to the game, at least not on Google. Also, I remember clearly that the first ""episode"" was distributed for ""free"", as ""shareware"".

Almost like a Zelda game. **Notable gameplay mechanics:** I recall having to collect green orbs (among other important items like currency and potions) throughout the game, solve puzzles and kill enemies along the way. **Other details:** I've never actually gotten very far in the game, but I have some faint memories of the beginning. I recall starting off in some sort of city in a desert. There was a pyramid of sorts at the top of the hub world map. I think you started off with some sort of weapon. Maybe not until you tried to squeeze by a few enemies first. I remember you'd have a helper with you. I think it was a golden owl? Maybe I'm mixing up the details there. Might have been made by Konami, but don't take my word for it.
8sjb6f	game	jdoc-annotated	reddit	early 2000s racing game. I really need help remembering a racing game from the early 2000s, maybe very late 90s, like 1998 to 2004 is my guess, but I know for sure it was on PC. It had I want to say about 6 or 8 playable characters, of which I remember 2, A stereotype Texan that drove a truck and the spare wheel cover had a picture of Texas on it, and a woman in her 20's or 30's with a white convertible. I don't remember how many tracks there were, but I do remember 3 of them, Hollywood, Yellowstone, and maybe Los Vegas, and during the race, the radio would switch music, and in the middle of one song, the host would say he had a caller, the caller would ask if she's on the air, and the host would say she is. I think there were short cinematics for each racer, too, and it was not realistic, some tracks had big jumps or drops, and the bushes were solid as concrete. Unfortunately, that's all I remember, but I hope this is enough to find out the name
8sg37r	game	jdoc-annotated	reddit	(3 Games) Girl Wakes Up at Home, in Hospital, on Train. **** CLARIFICATION, THIS IS A SERIES OF THREE GAMES THAT ARE ALL CONNECTED. SAME CHARACTER THROUGHOUT, SAME TIMELINE, SAME UNIVERSE. I believe they all have the same title just with either a [2] or [3] for the succeeding installments.) -Computer / PC game -Horror, point-and-click interactions (lots of jumpscares, scary af) - 3 part series (first game was in her house, second in a hospital, third on a train) - Main character was a young girl (either Asian or white or something, she was pale idk) - Probably made in the early 2000s (I played it in elementary school which was about ~2010 times) - No dialogue This game scared the living hell out of me and my friends when I was younger, back in about 2009 / 2010. It was a series of 3 separate games, which I'll try to describe below. Game One: The House - Wake up in bedroom - Mom and Dad not home at some late hour of the night for some reason - Dead quiet - Freaky scary shit happens in the bathroom - Handprintjumpscare.gif - I think there was some spacebar mashing in order to not get killed - You locked some trunk in your room for some reason or another so you had to go get the key - Also have some VHS or something - Put VHS in VHS player in parent's room - Same creepy bitch from the bathroom comes walkin in - Hide under the bed so you don't get murdered by creepy bitch - More spacebar mashing - Blah Blah Blah eventually get the key - Open the trunk - Get flashlight - The game ends with you (the girl character) walking down the stairs in complete darkness with your flashlight Game Two: The Hospital - Wake up on hospital bed - Ohfuck.jpg - Bloody tools all around you on the tables - GTFO the operation room - Walk around turning on lights and shit - Place is absolutely abandoned except for one thing ... - Creepy bitch is back - Hide behind hospital curtains to avoid being slaughtered - More spacebar mashing if she pulls the curtains back - The door to the basement / exit is locked - Do some fancy convoluted shit to get the key - Creepy bitch is still wanderin the halls at the speed of a turtle - Eventually get out (I never actually finished the game but I had looked up a how-to guide on it when I had played it several years ago, some shit about using soda machines and plants and shit ?!) Game Three: The Train - Wake up on a train - Place is fucking empty again - The seats are all orange - The train is moving but you don't remember where you're going - Train goes into tunnel and outside goes dark I never finished the last two games (the third one I gave up on because I got stuck like a minute in and didn't have the intelligence to look up a walk-through) but I hope that's enough information. I'd love to know if anyone else every played one, two or all three of these games and could tell me what they were called ! Maybe now that I'm older they won't scare me as much. (Lmao probably not)

A camera angle somewhere between topdown and side angle, almost like looking at people walking across a hill** **Notable characters: No specific characters, but had different factions you could choose with different units, like humans, orcs, etc. and standard units like pikemen, swordsmen, and cavalry** **Notable gameplay mechanics: You would pay for units with a refreshing pool of points (mana, gold) or buy them between battles and they would go into cooldown whenever you sent them out, they run directly across the battlefield and fight whatever is in the way, to try and destroy a base on the other side**
8qmzti	game	jdoc-annotated	reddit	[PC/DOS][199?]Ludo-like racing game. This is a Game i played when i was a kid, but that was quite some time ago so my memory about this game is a bit hazy. **Platform(s):** i am pretty sure it was for DOS/PC **Graphics/art style:** cartoony, bright and colorful **Notable gameplay mechanics:** the game had a top down view of the map with different places were your character could be, that were connected to form the track. it looked similiar to the map view in Super mario 3. It didnt actually have typical racing game gameplay, you moved around the map from point to point by the roll of a die, but i am not sure. There wre different characters with having his own unique car, a bit like wacky races. The cars could turn into a plane over water. I am sorry if this if this description is a bit vague but that is all i can remember.
8o9kr3	game	jdoc-annotated	reddit	[Sega Saturn] Fantasy JRPG from magazine preview. **Platform(s):** Sega Saturn **Genre:** Japanese-produced Fantasy RPG (not sure if JRPG) **Estimated year of release:** mid/late in Saturn's release cycle **Graphics/art style:** 3d characters and environment, mostly isometric camera angle **Other details:** This has been bugging me for a while - I remember reading a preview of a fantasy rpg for Saturn in some magazine but I don't know if it actually came out or what it's name was. The only thing I really remember is a screenshot of the main character (some sort of fantasy knight) standing in a town/village on a raised walkway. The palette was very grey/washed out, and the town seemed to have lots of raised walkways that crossed back and forth. It reminded me very much of the Genesis game 'Light Crusader', but if it was done with 90s 3d. From what I can remember it was more 'low' fantasy/medieval rather than high-fantasy particles and magic.
8pvlur	game	jdoc-annotated	reddit	Old game about a house burning down and killing chickens. Platform: PC Genre: Top down RPG Year: late 90's Details : So u played as a guy and I remember having to feed animals in it and soon after there's a fire. Unfortunately that's all I can recall , I also remember there were very tough enemies with baraka (mortal kombat) like hands. You could punch everything from what I recall. It is my earliest recollection of a RPG. I know it's not enough to go on but figuring this game out would help a lot as its been over 20 years since I played the game and I'm going on an old game playing spree.
8s9hjj	game	jdoc-annotated	reddit	Looking for weird side-scrolling game. I once played this game when I was a kid. What I remember is the first enemies that you encounter are kind of like slime monsters and once you defeat them they turn into these ugly little things with wings that you collect? Sounds weird but that is the only thing that I remember...
8r1p1m	game	jdoc-annotated	reddit	Looking for an old game similar to dig-dug. 2D game that looks, and also you move and dig sands just like dig\-dug. But game play is different. It's a game you dig around, kill spider and red round face enemy with a red orb, or a green spongy tile. Don't know how to beat the level, but you open a gate from a level, and go back and enter. It has multiple stages. * Controls: Up, right, left, right. * Gameplay : Main character is a blond male. You start from top\-left. The sand is yellow, and background color that appears after you dig is black. There are 2 types of enemies. One is a grey spider that moves along the wall, and the other is a round red face that moves in a straight line cardinally. You touch the enemy (when the enemy is right adjacent to you), you die. You kill them by pushing a red orb bombs just like a boulder from dig\-dug. There's also a tile that kills enemy when it touches. It's a green spongy tile with 2 holes. It disappears after enemy dies. The exit is a stone arched gate. Forgot how to open it though. It's a fixed tile. * Graphic/sprite: It is also similar to dig\-dug. All the enemy,player sprites face the screen(you). So spider's sprite is as if you looked at it from above, 4 legs at each side. Not sure but it has 2 eyes. Red round face enemy is just a red circle with 2 pixels of eyes (just like a pig's from minecraft), a nose, and a mouth that it constantly opens and closes. * Levels: There are some distinct things I remember from levels. First level: You start from Top\-left, it is a small room with a spider, 2 exits. Outside, top\-right, there are lots of red bombs. At the bottom, there are lots of spiders in a single dug\-out line, strange for them to be so many as it being the first level. I remember not having to touch it. \-\-\-\-\- It was from a collection that also had bubble\-bobble, dig\-dug. But the collection itself won't help. I've done researches for days, but I couldn't find any. Really appreciated if you know what game I'm having a problem with! Not: Supaplex, Boulder Dash, Digger T. Rock, Quarries of Scred, Digging Jim, etc.
8r5tco	game	jdoc-annotated	reddit	[NES][90s]Sidescroller with a dog sidekick.. This is driving me INSANE. **Platform(s):** NES **Genre:** Linear motroidvania **Estimated year of release:** 1990s **Graphics/art style:** 8 bit, several landscapes **Notable characters:** You are a fighter with a dog as a sidekick, the dog performs attacks occasionally. The original boss is a giant guy that takes up 1/2 of the screen. You know when you're closer to beating him because his face changes from purple to red or vice-versa. Occasionally, you'll run into a shop keeper as you're working your way across the level to buy new abilities from that you can perform with your dog. **Notable gameplay mechanics:** **Other details:** Early on in the game, you're scaling a mountain to get to the top, fighting enemies along the way. Toward the middle of the game, you were able to fall through false pitfalls that would normally kill you, but they sent you to a secret area. Later on in the game, you end up in a volcano where pretty much everything is on fire.
8oh72l	game	jdoc-annotated	reddit	[PC/DOS][~1996] Educational farming sim about hunger in africa. **Platform(s):** PC, DOS **Genre:** Farming simulation **Estimated year of release:** Played around 1996, was probably old at that time **Graphics/art style:** A very basic side/cutaway/schematic view of of your farmland, which seemed to be located on a slope. Black ""nothing"" as a background, the rest is represented by text and simple geometric shapes, which were outlined in color, but otherwise black. Similar to the 1st Oregon Trail game, but even uglier. **Notable characters:** You played a poor African farmer, but there are no characters to be seen. **Notable gameplay mechanics:** A farming simulation - you select an area, choose what to do there. Since the farmland was located on a slope, you needed to build terraces before growing anything. I remember millet being a possible crop. The game was turn-based, with one action per field and month. Or per season, not sure. I never managed to beat the game or get even close to it, you are close to bankruptcy/starvation right from the start, and random natural disasters, droughts and such make it even harder. **Other details:** I played the game on the school's library computer (the only accessible computer we had at the time). There was a rumour that the game was intentionally designed to be unbeatable to raise awareness of famines in africa. I _thought_ the title was ""hunger in africa"", but I can't find anything of the sort. I came across a game ""food force"" when googling, but that one is far too new and pretty.
