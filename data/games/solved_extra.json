Taking place mostly at night. Main character reminded me heavily of batman. I remember a decent amount of purple. The level required me to collect something, keys I think. I know the game was pretty hard, but was also like 5 or 6 so it could have been wet. It had a more cartoony feel than anything else.

Platform: PC Genre: Horror Year: 2010's? No Earlier than 2000's Graphics: Realistic, 3D rendered, dark, dirty. Third person fixed camera/ side on? Maybe 1st person or some portions may zoom to first to show certain elements (art/ the weapon you are building). Characters: You play as an adult (20-40 yo) woman who is captured by a serial killer. He is possibly a doctor of some kind and may wear a surgical mask. I only remember those two characters being present in the game and for some reason I can't seem to picture either of them. Setting: Present day, serial killer's murder basement. The map consists of several rooms. Some of them include a cooler-like room where you wake up, a room or rooms full of human dioramas, a tool room/ workshop and the man's kill room where he works on corpses. Possibly with a dentist's style chair under a bright light in the center. I think the exit is on the far side of this room. Gameplay: You wake up in a serial killer's basement. You discover that he is posing his victim's bodies to recreate famous paintings. For some reason you have to find the missing element to some of these dioramas to finish the picture. For example: adding an earring to *Girl with a Pearl Earring*. You must sneak around through several connected rooms without attracting the killer's attention, completing puzzles and building a weapon. I believe there were multiple variations of the weapon you could build. One was a circular sawblade on a stick or pipe. The killer spends most of his time in his kill room. I think you have to fight your way past him to escape. Other: I believe I watched a YouTuber play this but I can't remember which one and my husband has no memory of it. For some reason I'm getting the memory confused with The Cat Lady, and the Heavy Rain DLC, so It's especially hard to pick apart. It did seem very much like a segment from Cat Lady and possibly a similar length but I believe the art was 3D rendered.
