There are different puzzles in the game, but the player had to always type the answer. [One of the the puzzles is guessing a number from 0 to 1,000 or 1,000,000. The player guess the number, and the AI tells the play to guess higher or lower. Each time the player get it wrong, the robot demeans them more.](#spoiler) Other details: The game is very depressing and nihilistic. During some part of the game, the AI says something like, [\"You could be creative and write a book. Just like every other human in the world.\"](#spoiler) The AI talks extensively about how the player is wasting time and is going to die. The goal is to escape the game, even with the AI constantly insulting the player.

I remember keys used to solve puzzles were like living tentacles and I think grabbed a players hand. Lots of stuff looked like a mix of an object with a living creature.

I can't remember the giants names, but there was a water giant, a leafy giant, and a stone giant if I recall correctly. The player controls the giants on a circular world each level. The water giant can create oceans, the stone giant makes mountains, and the leaf giant creates life. Each level had different problems to solve to get more powers for the giants. For example, the water giant makes an ocean so the forest giant can make a forest, and if you put a mountain in the forest you create a desert on the other side of it. Eventually there are humans on your world that make settlements and have ambassadors that can ride on the giants shoulders. That's as far as I got in the game before I moved to another town and stopped thinking about the weird game ever again.

Educational enough that we were allowed to play it at school as a reward for finishing our work. **Estimated year of release:** I played it during late elementary school (I'm 30), so it was probably released somewhere from 1996-1998 plus or minus a couple years on each side. **Graphics/art style:** What I remember the most is interacting with/recreating fine art. I specifically remember Van Gogh's Sunflowers and some other still life paintings. Possibly some Monet as well but I'm not 100&amp;#37; sure on that. It was trying to be realistic. I remember being impressed by the graphics of the mansion (could have been a museum or big house) setting. I feel like it was probably trying to be 3D because I remember wandering through the rooms of the mansion. **Notable characters:** I don't remember there being any other characters, but it's possible. I just remember the first person nature of it. **Notable gameplay mechanics:** I remember a lot of clicking and dragging type actions to interact with the paintings. Probably point and click as well to go from one room to another. I also remember wandering around a big house/mansion and going from room to room to play games/interact with paintings. I specifically remember placing apples and bananas in the right spots to recreate a still life painting. **Other details:** This was a game that a classmate brought to school (it was a Montessori school) in elementary school in the late 90's. She would have brought the game to school at some point during 1997-1999, but it could have been released earlier than that. I remember searching for the game in stores when I was in middle school and couldn't find it. I never asked my friend for the name of the game and unfortunately she passed away when I was in high school. I don't think it was specifically an educational game, but our teacher would let us play it during breaks or as a reward for finishing work.

Educational enough that we were allowed to play it at school as a reward for finishing our work. **Estimated year of release:** I played it during late elementary school (I'm 30), so it was probably released somewhere from 1996-1998 plus or minus a couple years on each side. **Graphics/art style:** What I remember the most is interacting with/recreating fine art. I specifically remember Van Gogh's Sunflowers and some other still life paintings. Possibly some Monet as well but I'm not 100&amp;#37; sure on that. It was trying to be realistic. I remember being impressed by the graphics of the mansion (could have been a museum or big house) setting. I feel like it was probably trying to be 3D because I remember wandering through the rooms of the mansion. **Notable characters:** I don't remember there being any other characters, but it's possible. I just remember the first person nature of it. **Notable gameplay mechanics:** I remember a lot of clicking and dragging type actions to interact with the paintings. Probably point and click as well to go from one room to another. I also remember wandering around a big house/mansion and going from room to room to play games/interact with paintings. I specifically remember placing apples and bananas in the right spots to recreate a still life painting. **Other details:** This was a game that a classmate brought to school (it was a Montessori school) in elementary school in the late 90's. She would have brought the game to school at some point during 1997-1999, but it could have been released earlier than that. I remember searching for the game in stores when I was in middle school and couldn't find it. I never asked my friend for the name of the game and unfortunately she passed away when I was in high school. I don't think it was specifically an educational game, but our teacher would let us play it during breaks or as a reward for finishing work. It was very popular and we would fight over who would get to play.

On the 4th level, one that I never manages to pass, you have to jump on the back of a waterbug and avoid a fish jumping out an attacking you.** **Notable gameplay mechanics: I think the arrow keys were used to move and the mouse, I do not think I used the WASD to move.** **Other details: You moved as an ant/insect through an area with dirt on the ground, you are below glass level so the grass acts as walls, You move through certain gates whenever you find a key, purple gates and light blue gates are what sticks out to me. I have no idea what it is called, but I know it probably was not too complicated to install since I know I managed to install it on my fathers computer when I got home from class. I think the protagonists were some kind of bug, or ant in keeping with the close to the ground, below the grass theme.

I think you were only allowed to do this when you died. I'm pretty sure it wasn't Skate 3 because I remember driving in a car? But I might be wrong. **Other details:** I only played this game for like 30 seconds. I was at some guy's house and we were playing it in his room, which is why I don't remember much. I think I was using a PlayStation controller and I remember the game was sort of set in summer.

I'd estimate it was released anytime between 2000 and 2006 based on how I remember it looking. I'll try to list absolutely everything I can remember about this game. It was a sci-fi third person shooter. I have a feeling it was taking some heavy Halo influences. The basic premise seemed to be that Humans could develop on multiple worlds. You were a Human on some world that wasn't Earth. Very early on a militaristic alien empire invades your world. You find out that Humans are somehow special and that this empire is hunting them down as soon as they find a planet where Humans have developed. Somehow during this attack you gain powers of some sort due to Humans being this special messiah-like race. You could use these abilities in conjunction with regular weaponry to defeat your enemies. At some point I think your planet is destroyed or at least invaded by this alien empire. They had either four arms or four legs and two arms, but I'm positive they had a total of 6 limbs. IIRC their colour-scheme was red and black. However you are saved during the invasion by another group of aliens who are wary of the harm it could bring them, but do know Humans are this special thing. They had very a purple / greyish motif and their ships were, IIRC, very biological or \"space elf\" looking. It's these aliens which explain the plot to you. The cover was very yellow with some slight green and orange influences to it. I believe it had your main character floating with his arms extended behind the title font but I can't be sure of that. I have a suspicion the title was some sort of single term like \"Revelation\" or something equally as ambiguous. I have a feeling the game either wasn't very good or just extremely unknown since I don't remember ever hearing about it outside of me owning a copy of it.

I'd estimate it was released anytime between 2000 and 2006 based on how I remember it looking. I'll try to list absolutely everything I can remember about this game. It was a sci-fi third person shooter. I have a feeling it was taking some heavy Halo influences. The basic premise seemed to be that Humans could develop on multiple worlds. You were a Human on some world that wasn't Earth. Very early on a militaristic alien empire invades your world. You find out that Humans are somehow special and that this empire is hunting them down as soon as they find a planet where Humans have developed. Somehow during this attack you gain powers of some sort due to Humans being this special messiah-like race. You could use these abilities in conjunction with regular weaponry to defeat your enemies. At some point I think your planet is destroyed or at least invaded by this alien empire. They had either four arms or four legs and two arms, but I'm positive they had a total of 6 limbs. IIRC their colour-scheme was red and black. However you are saved during the invasion by another group of aliens who are wary of the harm it could bring them, but do know Humans are this special thing. They had very a purple / greyish motif and their ships were, IIRC, very biological or \"space elf\" looking. It's these aliens which explain the plot to you. The cover was very yellow with some slight green and orange influences to it. I believe it had your main character floating with his arms extended behind the title font but I can't be sure of that. I have a suspicion the title was some sort of single term like \"Revelation\" or something equally as ambiguous. I have a feeling the game either wasn't very good or just extremely unknown since I don't remember ever hearing about it outside of me owning a copy of it. And even then I think I scored that copy for a couple bucks at a second-hand store. I'll happy try to answer any extra questions you might have about it that might help us narrow it down.

But game play is different. It's a game you dig around, kill spider and red round face enemy with a red orb, or a green spongy tile. Don't know how to beat the level, but you open a gate from a level, and go back and enter. It has multiple stages. * Controls: Up, right, left, right. * Gameplay : Main character is a blond male. You start from top\\-left. The sand is yellow, and background color that appears after you dig is black. There are 2 types of enemies. One is a grey spider that moves along the wall, and the other is a round red face that moves in a straight line cardinally. You touch the enemy (when the enemy is right adjacent to you), you die. You kill them by pushing a red orb bombs just like a boulder from dig\\-dug. There's also a tile that kills enemy when it touches. It's a green spongy tile with 2 holes. It disappears after enemy dies. The exit is a stone arched gate. Forgot how to open it though. It's a fixed tile. * Graphic/sprite: It is also similar to dig\\-dug. All the enemy,player sprites face the screen(you). So spider's sprite is as if you looked at it from above, 4 legs at each side. Not sure but it has 2 eyes. Red round face enemy is just a red circle with 2 pixels of eyes (just like a pig's from minecraft), a nose, and a mouth that it constantly opens and closes. * Levels: There are some distinct things I remember from levels. First level: You start from Top\\-left, it is a small room with a spider, 2 exits. Outside, top\\-right, there are lots of red bombs. At the bottom, there are lots of spiders in a single dug\\-out line, strange for them to be so many as it being the first level. I remember not having to touch it. \\-\\-\\-\\-\\- It was from a collection that also had bubble\\-bobble, dig\\-dug. But the collection itself won't help. I've done researches for days, but I couldn't find any. Really appreciated if you know what game I'm having a problem with! Not: Supaplex, Boulder Dash, Digger T.

But game play is different. It's a game you dig around, kill spider and red round face enemy with a red orb, or a green spongy tile. Don't know how to beat the level, but you open a gate from a level, and go back and enter. It has multiple stages. * Controls: Up, right, left, right. * Gameplay : Main character is a blond male. You start from top\\-left. The sand is yellow, and background color that appears after you dig is black. There are 2 types of enemies. One is a grey spider that moves along the wall, and the other is a round red face that moves in a straight line cardinally. You touch the enemy (when the enemy is right adjacent to you), you die. You kill them by pushing a red orb bombs just like a boulder from dig\\-dug. There's also a tile that kills enemy when it touches. It's a green spongy tile with 2 holes. It disappears after enemy dies. The exit is a stone arched gate. Forgot how to open it though. It's a fixed tile. * Graphic/sprite: It is also similar to dig\\-dug. All the enemy,player sprites face the screen(you). So spider's sprite is as if you looked at it from above, 4 legs at each side. Not sure but it has 2 eyes. Red round face enemy is just a red circle with 2 pixels of eyes (just like a pig's from minecraft), a nose, and a mouth that it constantly opens and closes. * Levels: There are some distinct things I remember from levels.
