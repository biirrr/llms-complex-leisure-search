43960	Trying to find the title/author of a book I once read...	I've tried searching on Amazon with what I believe the title to be ""After Dark"", but it gives too many results. I've tried many different search combinations, and still nothing. I had this book in paperback in 1995/1996. The cover was red and orange, with a female vampires face reflected off of water. It was about a vampire plague that has swept the world. There are survivors in one city trying to survive the organized vampire group. The end up defeated by a bacteria that destroys their bodies. Has anyone else come across this book? Who is the author? Many thanks to anyone who might be able to help!	books	Toine	1	0	NA	0	NA	1	NA	NA	1	NA	0	NA	0	0	0	NA	0	1	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	1	0	1	NA	0	1	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	1	0	0	1	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	NA	NA	NA	NA	NA
91836	True Crime/Mystery author recommendations	Hello group! New member here. I have been wanting to get into the True Crime and Mystery genres for a while now, but have been too daunted by all the unknown (to me) authors when I was at a book store to ever make a purchase. That is why I have come here, to get some recommendations for good books/authors in the genres to get me started and give me a taste of what is available. If you feel you need to know more about my personal tastes to make a good recommendation feel free to ask. Thanks in advance.	books	Marijn	0	0	NA	0	NA	0	NA	NA	0	NA	0	NA	0	0	0	NA	0	1	0	0	0	0	1	0	0	0	0	0	NA	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	1	0	1	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	NA	NA	NA	NA	NA

I'd like to put in a couple of books by Mexican writers. I don't think I've read anything from that part of the world so need some suggestions.

128111	Regional Hiking Guides	As a lifelong Southern Californian, I'd be surprised if I've not encountered almost every hiking guide covering California's mountains, deserts, and national parks. Jerry Schad was probably the best hiking guide author in Southern California -- I liked his Afoot and Afield series of guides the best for their map and trail mileage accuracy and just general meticulousness -- though John W. Robinson, Thomas Winnett and even J. C. Jenkins, short life he lived, remain very helpful in planning excursions. Having been there done that with California, though, I'd be interested in hearing other hiking guide recommendations for other states and regions of the world. Ones that are special to you. I enjoy reading hiking guide trip descriptions from areas I'm not familiar with. Next best thing to being there. And especially guides that include great colorful topos whose contour lines and trails are actually readable w/out pulling out the magnifying glass.	books	Mette	1	0	NA	0	NA	1	NA	NA	0	NA	0	NA	0	0	1	NA	0	1	0	0	0	0	1	0	0	0	0	0	NA	0	0	0	1	0	0	0	0	1	0	0	0	0	1	0	1	0	0	1	0	0	0	0	0	NA	NA	NA	NA	NA
108055	Mystery - but not police procedural...	I'm in a rut and would love some mystery suggestions. But, I don't think I care for police procedurals. I find the writing in most to be too dry and ""gritty"" for my tastes. How about a list of mysteries that fall into other categories?

46541	Looking for recommendations	Hello. I was wondering if some of you could help me out with some recommendations... A good friend of mine has a seven year old son who is somewhat of a reluctant reader- that is to say, typically only interested in books about Pokemon. However, he was over at my place a while back and picked up a copy of Frindle that my roomie had left lying about. He really liked it and picked up a copy to share with his son who, to his delight, also really enjoyed it. They are now happily burning their way through Mr. Clement's other works. The problem is that they are getting close to the end. My friend would like some recommendations of similar authors that they could check out, who write at a low enough level that his son (who reads at grade two level) could do some of the reading himself. My tastes run more to the fantasy realm, so I am not much help. Any thoughts?	books	Marijn	0	0	NA	0	NA	0	NA	NA	0	NA	0	NA	0	0	0	NA	0	1	1	0	0	1	0	0	0	0	0	0	NA	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	1	0	1	0	0	1	0	0	0	0	0	NA	NA	NA	NA	NA

66178	Terry Pratchett, Discworld Audiobooks. Help!	Hi! :-D I've never really posted in the talk forums before, so I apologize in advance if I make any etiquette missteps. Anyway, I have a dilemma and could use your advice! I have two audiobook credits on audible.com. I know that I want to get Discworld books, and more specifically books about the Watch in Ankh-Morpork, but I can't decide on just two! Here are my top options: -Feet of Clay, directly follows The Fifth Elephant, which is the last book I bought. Read by Nigel Planer, who is not my favorite narrator, since he does the characters weird compared to how I imagine them. He's still good, just different. Also, I agree with a reviewer who wrote somewhere that he makes all the characters sound like they have a bad head cold or are chronically stupid. -Jingo, which follows Feet of Clay. Also read by Nigel Planer. -Night Watch, which I've already read, but it's one of my favorite books of all time and I've never listened to it in audio. Unlike the first two, it's read by Stephen Briggs, who is one of my favorite audiobook readers of ALL TIME. Synopsis.. Pros: favorite book, favorite narrator. Cons: read already, no Captain Carrot (my favorite character ever). -The Truth. Mostly I just want this because of Stephen Briggs' narration. I've read it quite recently. Also, not technically a Watch book. So! I don't really want two Nigel Planer books, but I'm thinking the first two are the best choices, since I haven't read either of them and I've read the other two. Though I do have print copies of all of these. Yes, I know I have an addiction. So What advice do you have? Thanks for all help!	books	Vivien	0	0	NA	0	NA	0	NA	NA	0	NA	0	NA	0	0	0	NA	0	1	0	0	1	1	0	0	0	1	0	0	NA	0	1	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	1	1	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	NA	NA	NA	NA	NA
47692	Histories of Jews in Eastern Europe or the Balkans	My favorite book on this topic has to be Beyond Hitler's Grasp: The Heroic Rescue of Bulgaria's Jews. This might be because I have always been a bit partial to Bulgarian studies, but I think it shows the Jewish plight in an interesting light. In my mind it showed that not all of the countries allied with the Nazis were full of hateful people. This was a story of neighbor helping neighbor. Most importantly, it showed the government of Bulgaria's struggle to survive the Nazi war-machine but protect all of its citizens. Bar-Zohar does an excellent job with his research and I highly recommend this book to anyone wanting to know more about the Balkans, WWII, or even how some Jews were able to return to Palestine/Israel. Another book I enjoyed reading was The Bielski Brothers. It's a story of bravery, not just among the partisans but the people who took them in. It also delves into the humanity of the situation. It takes away the idea of numbers, which tend to numb the mind to what actually happened. The one thing that was a bit more disturbing about this book was the reaction of the Polish people. Some of them are so viciously anti-Semitic that it makes one sick. I have read a lot of Polish history and the reason Poland had such a large Jewish population at the time is due to it being historically Semite-friendly. Jews flocked to Poland to get away from oppressive regimes in France, England, Spain, Italy and so on. There are stories in this book about how average people stood up and risked their lives to help their neighbors.  What are some other readers' picks for this topic? Or anything remotely related I guess.	books	Maria	1	0	NA	0	NA	0	NA	NA	1	NA	1	NA	0	1	1	NA	0	1	0	0	0	1	1	0	0	0	0	0	NA	0	1	0	1	0	1	0	1	0	0	0	0	0	1	0	0	1	0	1	0	0	0	0	0	NA	NA	NA	NA	NA

57827	Illustrated children's fiction book	There was a series of books I read when I was in elementary school, around 13 years ago. Aimed towards 2nd or 3rd grade reading level? It was, in general, one page of text, and one page of colored pictures. The pictures were quite vivid and brightly colored, and had a realistic style. The first page of each book would be all descriptions, I think. Talking about how beautiful the glade or whatever was. Setting the scene. I don't remember most of the plots. There was one about... horses, I believe. Maybe a horse that had no friends? I remember another one was about this cat that was very fat, and could not catch mice. One day a mouse comes along and helps the cat exercise, and the cat loses weight. It was a series, but the books did not share characters or anything. Like most children's books, they all had some sort of message. They were not that short. I don't think they had chapters, but they were not like those children books that only have one line of text per page. They were taller than a trade-paperback, and maybe around a centimeter thick.

Every time I post here I say that I know I should visit more often, but with work, books,and Lord of the Rings Online (:P, it's quite addicting), LibraryThing has unfortunately fallen off my list of things to do far too often. Now I come to you guys again. My brother and I have always been polar opposites: he was the jock, the popular guy, the non-reader, the one who thought I was a geek for loving Star Wars and Lord of the Rings... but now he wants to read and I need some ideas. He's read a bit of Lord of the Rings and enjoyed it, he's read a bit of Wheel of Time and enjoyed it, he's read a bit of Harry Potter and enjoyed it. I honestly think he'd enjoy the Dresden Files series, but it's currently checked out at the library I work at. I'm horrible at suggesting books. I'm also a picky person when it comes to fantasy (""everything reminds me of Tolkien!"").

20772	Name this short story about the Big Bang	I've been trying to track down this short story for a while, but can't remember/google either the author or title. It's about a person who suddenly wakes up and is trapped in his head, realizes he has no access to any of his outside senses, and in an attempt to stave off gradual insanity, he invents an elaborate world in his head, creating forces of 'good' and 'evil', constantly dueling it out, to ensure the story never ends. The last words of the story are 'Let there be light'. It's extremely short, probably only a few pages long.

31925	Please recommend a long good book!	I need a really good book for a month-long trip to Africa, because I won't be able to go to bookstores and because there are weight restrictions. My problem is I don't like fantasy and I don't like historical fiction (though I loved Anna Karenina and War and Peace years ago), so that eliminates quite a few books. Yesterday I bought ""Until I Find You"" by John Irving, but the reviews on LT don't look so hot. I like some of Irving's books but not all; I love William Boyd; I like memoirs. I took ""I Know This Much is True"" by Wally Lamb on a kayaking trip and loved it. I'd like to find something like that: about family relationships, or coming-of-age, or gay relationships like ""The Line of Beauty."" I love anything by Ian McEwan, but I've read most of his; I loved ""Lizzie's War"" by Tim Farrington. If anyone knows any long books along these lines (preferably longer than 500 pp) I'd really appreciate some recommendations!	books	Marijn	1	0	NA	0	NA	0	NA	NA	0	NA	0	NA	0	0	1	NA	0	1	0	0	0	0	1	0	0	1	0	0	NA	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	1	1	1	0	0	0	0	1	0	0	0	0	0	NA	NA	NA	NA	NA

123020	Secondary-World/Historical Fantasy with ""Mystery"" element	Sorry for the overly specific subject. :) I'm looking for recs of fantasies that have a central plot element of characters solving a mystery or just plain ""figuring things out"", as opposed to adventuring to defeat the bad guys or political maneuvering to make sure the right people gain/retain power. (Not that most books won't have a mix of those things, but I'd like the mystery-solving to be center stage.) As the subject mentions, I'm particularly looking for something that's not in the real world or a historical/pre-industrial time period. I've never been able to get into modern-day/urban fantasy, so the Dresden Files and that brand of supernatural detective stories just do not appeal to me at all. Some examples of the sort of thing I'd like to find: List of Seven (Mark Frost) / Death of the Necromancer (Martha Wells) / Lady in the Loch (Elizabeth Scarborough) - Stories set in Victorian(-ish) settings with strong investigative plot-threads. StarCrossed (Elizabeth C. Bunce) - A ""bottle"" sort of story, with characters all trapped together in a castle and our heroine figuring out everyone's secrets. Idylls of the Queen (Phyllis Ann Karr) - Arthurian murder mystery Also, as a related ""what was that book?"" question: A few years ago, I saw a book that I believe was a murder mystery set in a castle where the main character was the captain of the guard or somesuch who could see ghosts (or saw this particular ghost, anyway). Does that ring any bells? I feel like it popped up a lot on Amazon for a few months, but I didn't save it off anywhere...	books	Toine	1	0	NA	0	NA	0	NA	NA	1	NA	1	NA	0	1	0	NA	0	1	0	0	0	0	1	0	0	0	0	0	NA	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	1	0	1	1	0	1	0	0	0	0	0	NA	NA	NA	NA	NA

113809	Multiracial adoption story, large family	I know it's a novel, and I think I read it about ten to twelve years ago. It was a book about a white couple who decided to adopt a child, then ended up adopting a double-digit number of them over the course of the book with no thought to nationality or special needs.  I remember some specific scenes. One had the couple so poor that they were forced to eat a five-to-ten year-old decorative can of rattlesnake meat, opening it from the bottom so that they could wash it out and continue to display it. Also, there was a scene later in the book in which one of the couple's black daughters begged her parents to wash her skin until it was white like theirs. My mother or grandmother gave this to me, so I'm pretty sure it was intended for young adult or adult audiences. It had chapters, so I'm pretty sure it wasn't a children's book or teen fiction. The edition I read was paperback, with a tan cover. On the cover was artwork depicting several people from the shoulders up- can't remember how many. It was a standard-sized paperback, maybe the width of an adult's index or middle finger.	books	Marijn	1	1	NA	0	NA	1	NA	NA	1	NA	0	NA	1	0	1	NA	0	1	1	0	0	0	1	0	0	1	0	1	NA	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	1	0	0	1	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	NA	NA	NA	NA	NA
17974	Teaching a world literature class	I got my dream job at my dream school this week and it includes a section of world literature. It's a high school class, but the students will advanced readers and writers. I can think of lots of great books from around the world, but I want to narrow the focus a little. I want my students to specifically consider who has voices in their own societies and the wider world, and how those voices have to be modified to be audible and intelligible to others. I'd also like my students to think about what they have in common with the groups, characters and societies we've read about in spite of geographic and cultural differences. I know for sure that I want to include Eastern European poets who tried their best to write around Communist governments. I'm thinking Ana Akhmatova and Czeslaw Milosz, but I'd be open to other suggestions as well. The Unbearable Lightness of Being is another obvious Eastern European choice, but I'm afraid to read about that much sex with high school students. Even very mature ones. Including African literature is also very important to me. Things Fall Apart is the most obvious choice, but I think the regular English class reads it so I need to choose something different. I'm thinking about The River Between, which I just finished, because it's not stylistically challenging but has some very interesting themes to work with. Any other suggestions? Not Half of a Yellow Sun, please. I'm not bound to old venerable works of literature, but something it's a little too recent. This is about as far as I've gotten in my course planning. Any suggestions for Latin American or Middle Eastern literature? How about immigrants in America? I've read a lot of great Asian literature this year, but none that really addresses the themes I want to discuss...	books	Mette	1	0	NA	0	NA	0	NA	NA	0	NA	0	NA	0	0	1	NA	0	1	0	0	0	1	1	0	0	0	0	0	NA	0	0	0	1	0	0	0	0	1	0	0	1	1	1	1	1	0	0	1	1	0	1	0	0	NA	NA	NA	NA	NA

57578	Indo Europeans	This summer semester before I do my Limes project, I'm going to have another independent study class on something to do with Indo-European culture/religion and its relation to its ""daughter cultures"" (one of our ideas is doing like a comparative mythology aspect). I was just wondering if you guys could recommend any specific books that I could use. I already have Mallory's ""In Search of the Indo Europeans"", Anthony's The Horse, the Wheel, and Language, and Renfrew's Archaeology and Language...was thinking of combining one of these with Puhvel's Comparative Mythology and then ___________ (ideally a book more focusing on PIE religion and society itself.)  Any suggestions? Right now I think I'm leaning towards West's ""Indo European Poetry and Myth"" (http://www.librarything.com/work/4661135), since my prof brought it up, but I think subconsciously for me it might be just because this one doesn't have one of those generic ""check it out, an overly scholarly book noone will ever read!!"" covers, if you know what I mean :-D And naturally anything that reminds me of my 6th grade math book is a bad thing, haha.

131236	Novel - Logging Family	I'm trying to help a patron at our library, but I haven't been able to come up with any ideas, and I'm hoping that maybe some of you can help.  About 10-15 years ago (so this is not a new book), the patron read a novel about a family that lived near a river and did logging. It was possibly set in the Depression-area. Near the end of the book, a dam was built on the river, changing their way of life.  It might help to know that the patron was an older woman, so I don't think the book was a juvenile novel (although it is possible). I know it's not very much to go on, but I'd appreciate any ideas you might have.

Okrent took pictures from the air between 1985 and 2010, and compares ""then & now"", pointing out the urban development & architectural changes. His commentary is what makes the book--really opens your eyes & mind to looking at buildings & green space. It's mostly downtown photos, but it's amazing how much has changed in the last 25 years.

68922	YA Fantasy about a young boy and a maze, in a cave and possible war between clans?	Some time in the early 80's I read a book that I cannot remember the name of. Since it was so long ago, I can only remember bits and pieces of it. This is what I remember: It was about a young boy who was sent to his room (on his birthday, I think) and looked out his window and saw a huge maze that started at his window. He walked the maze to mountains and the next thing I remember was that he found himself in a cave for a long time. They (the clan) used animal hides to cover the entrance of the cave and I remember the character talking about coming out of the cave at some point and the light being extremely bright. I vaguely remember the clan he was with was going to war and it was up to him to save the world or something like that.  Unfortunately that's all I remember!

129136	Kids' activity book about a little boy and sister in search for the legend of the giant turtle	Hi, I used to have this book when I was much younger (~1997) about a boy and his sister (I think Aztecan) who set off in search of a legendary giant turtle. It is more or less an activity book which had a tablet-like-bookmark (made of card, of course, with dimensions roughly ~10x10 cm). The corners of this tablet-like-bookmark had bees on them, and about 5 holes to see through. Throughout the book there were hidden things we had to find by placing the tablet on each page, aligning the bees on the tablet to various coloured bees on the pages. The correct orientation of the tablet would reveal these hidden objects.  Usually each double page had 3 things we had to find: 1) Our next destination.  2) How to get there (either by road, river, bridge, etc.).  3) A small activity regarding that particular page. The book was not very long, about 30 pages or so but, it was very coulourfull. Enough to hide all the objects and markings. A few pages I can remember are: The Ravine, where a monster is in the ravine which you need to cross by walking on one of the two wooden bridges. One of the bridges has maggots in them and will break. So this is where you use the tablet, with the help of the bees, to know which bridge is safe to cross. Other pages include The Observatory, The Waterfall. Unfortunately I really can not remember the rest. This book was targeted at ages 5~9 (I guess). I would really appreciate it if anyone knew it. It was so much fun at the time, just wish to get my hands on it again and preserve it! The title sounds something like: Legend of the Giant Turtle or Search for the Giant Turtle or The Giant Turtle of ...	books	Maria	1	1	NA	0	NA	1	NA	NA	1	NA	0	NA	0	0	0	NA	0	1	1	0	0	0	0	0	0	1	0	1	NA	0	1	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	1	0	0	1	0	1	0	0	0	0	0	NA	NA	NA	NA	NA

87173	Fantasy, band search for magical trumpet/horn	Hi, Read this fantasy paperback about 12 years ago I think. It was about an apprentice magician who knew 'real' magic, which we see as an understanding of chemical reactions and physics throughout the book (in contrast to those who could just do illusions or conjure visions). He impresses a man recruiting for a magic user by changing the colour of a coin, and joins up with a band of adventurers. I remember he uses magic again when on a boat on a river, throwing something into the water to either make it set on fire or put it out, I forget which. The plot ends up revolving around a powerful horn-type instrument which they are looking for, and it turns out to belong to a giant titan figure, as the tip of one of its giant horns. I think it's from a reasonably well known fantasy writer... just can't for the life of me find it using google.

Also, sometimes, writers I don't like. Sometimes I get impatient with the fiction, but they have a massive audience to please, not just me.  At the mention of non-fiction all the thoughts just skittered out of my brain like mice running away from the cat.	books	Marijn	0	0	NA	0	NA	0	NA	NA	0	NA	0	NA	0	0	0	NA	0	1	0	0	0	0	1	0	0	0	0	0	NA	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	1	0	1	0	0	1	0	0	0	0	0	NA	NA	NA	NA	NA

102833	Looking for something epic.. need recommendations please :p	I've just about finished reading Good Omens by Niel Gaiman / Terry Pratchett, but now I'm ready for something a bit different. I'm looking for something well written, with a lot of action / twists and turns, and..very importantly, interesting and enjoyable characters. Something along the lines of George R.R. Martins work/Game of Thrones. Anyone have a good recommendation? I want something that feels epic -- and is a real page turner -- if that makes sense.  Thanks!!!

71406	Intelligent, romantic high fantasy with enthralling sensual scenes?	I like intelligent touching books with great characters and life lessons that are meaningful and hopeful. I also love epic romance and look forward to sensual/sex scenes. But I haven't found books that have everything. If its urban fantasy (which usually have more romance and sex) the characters and their language are mostly contrite and downright laughable. If its romance its usually too mushy and superficial in its storyline. If it's interesting in its plot the romance is stiff and even though there's a lot of mentioning about sex usually the actual sex scenes are not that gripping. When one mentions sex and dark fantasy or epic/high fantasy the books that are mostly discussed or recommended are the Kushiel series. But in my opinion they do revolve around the topic of sex but it's never aspiring sex so it's not moving just maybe amusing. So are there any well written/created epic fantasy novels with great romance and passionate intimate scenes?	books	Marijn	1	1	NA	0	NA	0	NA	NA	1	NA	0	NA	1	0	0	NA	0	1	0	0	0	0	1	0	0	0	0	0	NA	0	0	0	1	0	0	1	0	1	0	0	0	0	1	0	1	0	0	1	0	0	0	0	0	NA	NA	NA	NA	NA

21768	help finding a book	Perhaps 5 years ago I read a book (I think the book was newly out then) about this woman who finds a time travel portal on her grandparents (I think it was) farm in the mountains somewhere in the eastern U.S. She goes through and finds herself in old England. It seems as if she has to disguise herself as a boy. The portal on that side is in a church I believe. She finds the love of her life in old England. Travels back and forth . Discovers that one of her relatives had also done the time travel.  If anyone has any suggestions for me I would certainly appreciate them.	books	Marijn	1	1	NA	0	NA	0	NA	NA	1	NA	1	NA	0	1	0	NA	0	1	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	1	NA	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	1	0	0	1	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	NA	NA	NA	NA	NA

67051	Children/YA book about mice going in a quest from the late 80's	Sorry but I don't know any more if I am mixing several books now.  This is what I remember:  It was the first of a series and asking my teacher if I could read the next one but she said it wasn't published yet. It was around 1989- 1990 (first year of secondary school and it was a compulsory read)  The mice lived in an old church or religious building: there was talk of stained windows.  There was some sort of quest that some or one of the mice went on, to obtain/deliver a Moonstone, or other mystical item/gemstone.  At least one scene that took place outdoors, at night, with clear skies and a full moon.  There was mention of a 'mouse artist' who painted several works of art. His trademark was to include an extra component in his paintings. In his early paintings, this extra component was really small, and impossible to identify, but with each painting, this component got bigger and bigger.    As I said, I don't know any longer if I have mixed one or more books here. Sorry I am so inaccurate. I definitelly know it's not Mrs Frisby and the rats of Nihm.  Thank you in advance if someone can give me a title or shed some light.	books	Toine	1	1	NA	0	NA	0	NA	NA	1	NA	1	NA	0	0	0	NA	0	1	1	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	1	NA	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	1	0	0	1	1	0	1	0	1	0	0	NA	NA	NA	NA	NA
3861	Trying to identify a short story...would appreciate help	- Short story written in the mid to late 1980s IIRC - Focus is two high school boys who are friends.  - immediate setting is a cafeteria/fast-food joint - wider setting are the high school kids living in an economically depressed US that is fighting an interminable war in Central America. Students wrestling with the pros and cons of joining up.  - background themes of govt propaganda to sustain recruiting and morale when things are dismal. The war is televised/fictionalised. Certain GIs get their 15 minutes of fame as 'Johnny America' IIRC. I think the enemy is 'Pedro'. light infantry are equipped with missiles as section/platoon weapons.  - story ends with some sort of fight in the cafeteria. one of the boys, and one of the girls decide to join up for their own reasons. - Not being able to remember anything else is making me a bit nutty. Hope I can track this down before the men in white jackets have to take me away.	books	Vivien	1	0	NA	0	NA	0	NA	NA	1	NA	1	NA	0	0	0	NA	0	1	0	0	0	0	1	0	0	0	0	1	NA	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	1	0	0	1	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	NA	NA	NA	NA	NA

129426	Suggestions for ""Involuntary Crimes of Love""	Sometimes finding books that fall into each situation can be a little hard. Let's help each other out! This thread is for Involuntary Crimes of Love. In this plot there must be a lover, a beloved, and a revealer. It is considered to be the most improbable of all the dramatic situations. Subcategories include: 1. Discovery that one has married one's mother. 2. Discovery that one has had a sister as a mistress. 3. Discovery that one has married one's sister. 4. Involutary crime of love villainously planned by a third person. 5. Being upon the point of taking a sister, unknowingly, as a mistress. 6. Being upon the point of violating, unknowingly, a daughter. 7. Being upon the point of committing an adultery unknowingly. 8. Adultery committed unknowingly. This one is a really tough one to find, probably because most of the time it's supposed to be a surprise. The most obvious suggestion is Oedipus. If you want something a little more recent I would add M. Butterfly, although this particular crime of love is not listed in the subcategories because it wasn't something people wrote about back then. Any others?	books	Marijn	1	1	NA	0	NA	0	NA	NA	1	NA	0	NA	0	0	1	NA	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	NA	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	1	0	1	0	0	1	0	0	0	0	0	NA	NA	NA	NA	NA
66749	Philosophy: objective basis of morality	So I'm in a bookshop in London about two weeks ago, browsing the philosophy section and writing down titles that look interesting, to check out from the library when I get home. One book sticks in my mind, and of course that's the one whose title I forgot to record. I only read a paragraph or two of the introduction, but the thesis is that morality is based on something objective, outside our minds. I distinctly remember a sentence that said morality would exist even if no one ever thought about it (or something close to that).  Any ideas? Thank you!

90045	Rich Older Woman Kidnapped! Or something like that....	Okay, a book just drifted back into my mind tonight. It's a least 5 years old, probably older. From what I remember of the plot, a rich older woman is kidnapped and taken to a secluded location. I think I remember it being rural- at least a cabin in the woods, maybe even tents. The one scene I really remember is that the kidnappers gave the woman an apple at one point, and are surprised by the fact that she eats the entire apple (core, seeds, and all). She explains something about her father teaching them not to be wasteful as children. Now for the vague part of my memory. I think that the old woman's family won't pay the ransom (bad blood and all that trite jazz), so she ends up being held by the kidnappers much longer than they anticipated. Unfortunately, I don't remember the ending, which is why I'm here. Does this ring bells for any of you lovely people?	books	Toine	1	1	NA	0	NA	0	NA	NA	1	NA	1	NA	0	0	0	NA	0	1	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	1	NA	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	1	0	0	1	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	NA	NA	NA	NA	NA

They have much better technology than their opponents. However, their opponents keep fighting while the empire keeps waiting for the next upgrade, not maintaining the (practically obsolete!) equipment they already have, pulling their ships back to update them...and they lose the war.

(Hey, give me a break...I'm 47 and have been reading since I was 4!) About the only detail I can recall is the heroes and villains used different colored ray weapons. Red and green, I believe. Not positive on the colors, mind you; but the fact that stuck in my head was each side only used that color. As I recall...or think I recall...the hero stumbles over the heroine, who is a member of an advanced society (I can't recall if she was an alien or time traveler), and of course gets drawn into the struggle. It was definitely pre-1980, and most likely pre-1970.

42904	YA?, about a girl who was almost invisible	I read this book about 5 years ago (maybe. I'm really bad with estimating time). I'm pretty sure it is young adult, but it may have been for kids in middle school. The book was about this girl that was (i guess) so tiny or washed out that nobody saw her unless they knew exactly where she was. She ends up just living inside the walls of her house, and her family kind of forgets about her. She creates all sorts of hidden passageways to get from one place to another. Eventually she grows to be a teenager and meets people on the ouside for the first time....and I think she then goes to a halloween party? she definetly meets a boy. I think it was after she overheard her mother talking to a man about the house getting destroyed and her mom didn't want that to happen even though she wasn't quite sure why.  I remember this one scene where the girl's mom arranged for a woman to come and meet her. Her mom put the girl on a chair next to a doll and the woman thought they were concerned about the doll or something....like she didn't even see the girl or realize that was who they were talking about. And then somehow the girl got stuck into the woman's purse and taken outside...and her mom was really upset. I think the girl had a sister, too. This might be way too much information or not enough. Let me know if you can think of the title or need more info!	books	Marijn	1	1	NA	0	NA	0	NA	NA	1	NA	0	NA	0	0	0	NA	0	1	1	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	1	NA	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	1	0	0	1	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	NA	NA	NA	NA	NA

I remember the entire plotline and the possible authors, but for the life of me, I cannot find the book and I must reread it. It's either by Christopher Pike or R.L. Stine and I read it probably 13 years ago. This girl visited this archaelogical site (a volcano?) and found a small statue that looked just like her. She swiped it, knowing it was against the law, and took it back to her hotel room.  Some stuff happened, and she comes to find out that she was a goddess that decided she wanted to fall to earth and take on the form of this girl who was in a coma. Her god-dad was so upset he put her god-blood in the statue and put it in her path so that if she changed her mind, she could be a god again.  The statue changes to a glass vial full of blood, something else happens, blah blah blah... then this evil person feeds her and her boyfriend ground up glass and they both start to die. Instead of using her god-blood on herself, she feeds it to her bf.

Grandfather paradoxes: Caused by attempts to change the past, and so modify the conditions that lead to the very existence of the entity that is trying to modify the timestream. 2. Bootstrap paradoxes: Where an effect is its own cause. (definitions taken from Visser's 'The quantum physics of chronology protection') The quintessential bootstrap story is Heinlein's All You Zombies... but what are some of your favorites?	books	Toine	1	0	NA	0	NA	0	NA	NA	0	NA	0	NA	0	0	1	NA	0	1	0	0	0	0	1	0	0	0	0	0	NA	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	1	0	1	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	NA	NA	NA	NA	NA

It's hard coming up with search parameters for this on the usual search engines. They need not be prize winners. Intricacy is what I'm looking for.

93190	Poetry Anthology Book--Need Title, please	I donated a poetry anthology several years ago. It is one of the few items I have regretted donating. Can anyone help with a title, given these clues? Published prior to 2000, most likely published before 1995. I did not have a jacket, but hardcover was a shade of red. Had a thinner red ribbon marker attached. Pages were white, of closer to tissue-paper thinness. All poems were in English, as I recall.  Spanned ancient times to the present (at time of publication). Had several ""shape"" poems toward end, including one shaped like the helix. Was about novel size and thickness. Possibly has a book publisher or book company name in the title. Many thanks. (Have done several online searches with ""shape poem"" and ""helix"" and have started looking through Amazon, using keyword--poetry anthologies, but no luck as of yet).	books	Vivien	1	0	NA	0	NA	1	NA	NA	0	NA	0	NA	1	0	0	NA	0	1	0	0	0	0	1	1	0	1	0	1	NA	0	1	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	1	0	0	1	0	0	1	0	0	1	0	NA	NA	NA	NA	NA

I have an extremely vague memory of a paperback book I read growing up in the '80s that featured a girl who would spend time in a windmill (or perhaps a boat or some other structure?) that was abandoned on her family's property (perhaps her grandmother's?). I seem to remember small details, like her hiking out to the windmill, bringing a picnic and sort of camping out there and reading books, which sounded like so much fun.

58855	YA book about a colony where all the adults are killed...	Hey, you might remember me as the guy who asked you all to name Time of the Great Freeze for me. Well, I have another one. This book takes place on a space colony where one of the local creatures (some kind of giant insect, I think) come out of hibernation every five years or so and stampede across the landscape like buffalo herds, devouring everything in their path. Well, the colonists weren't aware of this when they decided to settle there. When the creatures came out of hibernation after their arrival all the adults in the colony were devoured and the only survivors were the children who were taking their classes inside the landed and partially cannibalized spacecraft that took them to that world. They were left alone with only the ship's AI to help them survive. The story is set just before the bugs are due to come out of hibernation for a second time. I have no idea about the story itself, only the backstory. I can't remember anything about the book's size, cover, year when it was written, nothing. I hope someone can help me out, it's really been BUGGING me!	books	Maria	1	1	NA	0	NA	0	NA	NA	1	NA	0	NA	0	0	0	NA	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	NA	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	1	0	0	1	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	NA	NA	NA	NA	NA

73205	children's ghost story - going to a party in a big house	Short story I read as a kid. Possibly I'm mixing it in my memory with other stories. In my memory, a big house shows up in the neighborhood, and holds a great party. It's everything a kid could want. Protagonist(s) want to go to the party, and do; they leave early, somehow, then discover the house was haunted or would have taken them away, or all the kids were ghost-kids, or something like that.  I read this story in a collection, but can't place it. I had thought perhaps in ""Alfred Hitchcock's Ghostly Gallery"" or ""Alfred Hitchcock's Haunted Houseful"" but can't verify.  I semi-recall another story that I think was in this collection (how many more vagaries can I include?) -- it somehow reminded me of the characters from The Wind in the Willows but involved, again, something spooky and out-of-character.  -- lquilter	books	Maria	1	0	NA	0	NA	0	NA	NA	1	NA	0	NA	0	0	0	NA	0	1	0	0	0	1	0	0	0	0	0	1	NA	0	1	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	1	0	0	1	0	1	0	0	0	0	0	NA	NA	NA	NA	NA

29950	Cold War recommendation?	BBC4, here in the UK, have just finished a rather good short series on political summits. The programmes focused on: - Munich 1938 (Chamberlain & Hitler) - Vienna 1961 (Kennedy & Khrushchev) - Geneva 1985 (Gorbachev & Reagan) The last two were selected because of their importance to the beginning and the ending of the main period of the Cold War. Watching these got me thinking about how shockingly little I know about the details of the Cold War, even though it was an ever-present situation for most of my life. I feel rather ashamed of my ignorance. So, I figure, I should do something about it.

Hi everyone I have a wonderful memory of my father reading me a book as a small child that I believe was called ""Things"" (not to be confused with ""Where the Wild Things Are""). I have been searching on the internet for ages but can't seem to find it. I was born in 1978 so I assume the book was either published in the 70s or the early 80s. It was mainly a picture book or weird imaginary pictures of weird hairy circular creatures called ""things"" .... each page had these fantastic pictures with wording like ""Big things and little things, Things in the moon, Shy Things and Loud Things"" etc....

124567	Theosophy And Weird Fiction	The more reading of/on weird fiction I do, the more I come across the topic of theosophy (http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Theosophy). It seems that most of the major weird fiction writers of the 20s and 30s (H.P. Lovecraft, Robert E. Howard, Clark Ashton Smith, etc.), while not necessarily taking theosophical thought terribly seriously, seemed to be tremendously inspired by it. Smith, for example, wrote (in a letter to HPL): ""Theosophy, as far as I can gather, is a version of esoteric Yoga prepared for western consumption, so I dare say its legendry must have some sort of basis in Oriental records. One can disregard the theosophy, and make good use of the stuff about elder continents, etc. I got my own ideas about Hyperborea, Poseidonis, etc. from such sources, and turned my imagination loose."" What do you folks know about this fascinating topic? Can anyone recommend a good introductory text on this philosophy?	books	Marijn	1	0	NA	0	NA	0	NA	NA	0	NA	0	NA	0	0	1	NA	0	1	0	0	0	0	1	0	0	0	0	0	NA	0	0	0	1	1	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	1	0	1	0	0	1	1	1	0	0	0	NA	NA	NA	NA	NA

35421	Book Suggestions	My 24 year old daughter is seriously dating a conservative, evangelical Christian. He accepts a literal interpetation of the Bible, i.e. the world was created in 7 days, etc.  I am a lapsed Catholic agnostic and my husband is an atheist. She was raised with no religious beliefs but was taught to respect the beliefs of others. Needless to say, this relationship is very disturbing to us. They have decided to explore each others religious beliefs (or lack of beliefs) through reading. He has loaned her a couple of books which she is reading. She has asked me to suggest books that she can lend to him. She is a science nerd so books that give scientific evidence supporting evolution, atheism, etc would be best.  I know what you're thinking... what is the world coming to when a science geek falls in love with a conservative Christian...I can't believe it myself. I would appreciate any suggestions. Thanks.	books	Vivien	1	0	NA	0	NA	0	NA	NA	0	NA	0	NA	0	0	1	NA	0	1	0	0	0	0	1	0	0	0	0	0	NA	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	1	0	1	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	NA	NA	NA	NA	NA

43576	1970's Children's book about midnight adventure	Dear bibliophiles, I'm trying to find the title of a book I read when I was a child in the 1970's (in the UK). I think the story was about a child getting out of bed in the middle of the night and going on an adventure, seeing something that scares them (was it an owl?) and then rushing back home. The one thing I clearly remember is the adventure is told in sequences of words such as around the lake, through the woods, up the hill.... and into bed etc etc Jog any memories?

Some very interesting stories by a few authors I'd never heard of.  The anthology also contains Yevgeny Zamiatin's sci fi/distopia novel We, which I'm finding quite interesting.  I was wondering whether anyone here had any thoughts on this novel and/or had any suggestions for additional works by Zamiatin. (I see the touchstone spells his name Zamyatin, but the book I'm reading has the first spelling.)

I'm looking for recommendations on SF books that are the opposite of post-apocalyptic or distopian stories --stories that show humanity at its best or, at least, a world in which all human existence is elevated beyond basic survival. I recently read the The Player of Games by Iain Banks and loved the idea of the Culture. I also liked the Commonwealth in Peter Hamilton's Pandora's Star. I'd like to find a book that explores how we could get there or that goes into more details of the inner workings of such a system.

Now, I know you aren't supposed to shamelessly plug yourselves here, but really, if I'm asking, I think it's ok. Unlike myself (I've only ever gotten work related stuff published) some of you are real published authors, not hobby writers, and I want to read some of your works. Does anyone have a great suggestion for me from an author in this group? I'll read almost anything as long as it's good! (Does that make me sound cheap?)  Thanks!

116650	Best stories in which the heroines have supernatural powers	I love fantasy; I enjoy comic-book mythos; but in general I like my heroines with powers -- some sort of supernatural abilities that lift them above the ordinary. I grow weary of seeing mundane women as either the protagonists of fantasy stories or the main female (love interest) in comic-book plots, and I'm tired of seeing the powerful women in such stories as either Evil or losers in love. For some reason, superheroes always seem to prefer mundanes. As for me, Lord and good writers deliver me from the Bella Swans of the fictional world. I'm looking for ANTI-Bella Swans. Please recommend me some good stories in which the female character is supernaturally gifted in a useful and meaningful way, in which we're meant to root for her and not against her, and in which she comes out on top. Please note, of course, that the operative phrase is ""GOOD stories,"" be they regular novels or graphic novels. Nothing overly juvenile or cheesy.

17113	Elements	Well, I've decided I really need to ask some questions, no matter how stupid I appear. I would be grateful for directions to any texts that might help me find the answers to these specific questions.  So, to start with: elements. I realise that the most common in use are the four: earth; air; wind; and fire. But these originated from the east or middle east. I have heard references to three elements in local trads, those being: land; sky; and sea. See this article: http://www.imbas.org/articles/elements_duile.html I have encountered the idea these three can be can be further broken down into nine elements. Is this the case in the so-called ""celtic"" traditions and, if so, which texts will help me to learn more. Any assistance by way of recommended texts will be greatly appreciated.	books	Mette	1	0	NA	0	NA	0	NA	NA	0	NA	0	NA	0	0	1	NA	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	NA	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	1	0	1	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	NA	NA	NA	NA	NA

63477	novel, monk gathering St. Catherine's relics	Fiction  I read this around 2000, it was absolutely not written after fall of 2001 since I read it before I went to Europe and I was looking for Catherine's Wheels in all the art while I was there thanks to this book. It was a novel, about a monk in the medieval period (I think, I'm suddenly unclear about this) who was seeking to gather together the relics of St. Catherine. Possibly ended in a hermitage in Alexandria. The monk could hear her scattered body parts talking to him, but his order did not feel that he should be doing this, so some other group is maybe trying to stop him or collect her before he does? I'm fuzzy on this. I don't think it was marketed as a supernatural book, or a religious book, or a crime thriller, but more just a story/novel. It may have had the word Translation/Translated in the title (not referring to translation of the book, but the religious term of translation in terms of the removal of relics). Arrgh, this is driving me nuts.

I would prefer a series though so that I can find a character I love and watch them grow, lol!  Normally I read classics and historical fiction. I also really enjoy contemporary fiction that involves a historical issue/person in some way. The only mystery stuff I have read is the Stephanie Plum series. I really enjoy it but it leans a little to far into romance for me. and it's very repetitive (especially by the time you get to book 14!). I would like something a little different I think.

35787	More Medieval recommendations?	Hi! I'm new to this group and apologize if this subject has been explored already, but I'd like some recommendations for accurate historical fiction about real people- or alternately, very engaging biographies. I've looked at some of the other recommended medieval authors, but it seems that many of those books are primarily romances or mysteries (more emphasis on the ""fiction"" than on the ""history""). I prefer books that are the other way around. I'd love to find the Medieval version of Colleen McCullough's ""Masters of Rome"" series. Any suggestions?

111181	Fanfiction / Buffy the Vampire Slayer -- ""No! I can't be the... last!""	This might be a new low for my Name That!! searches, but I have this niggling fanfiction plot in my head that I am dying to pin a title too. It was a Buffy the Vampire Slayer fic (TV show flavor) that was probably hosted on fanfiction.net. I probably read it around 2003-2005, when I read a lot of fanfiction as a happy outlet for my graduate school-deadened brain. The fic was futuristic dystopian, and the current slayer (not Buffy, but I don't think that was clear at the story's start) was living in the aftermath of some cataclysmic event. She found herself fighting fewer and fewer vampires, and it was only after she realized how long it had been since she'd last seen any person, even a vampire, that she realized the cataclysm had effectively killed off the human population and with it the vampire population had followed. The last line of the story paraphrased along the lines of, ""No... no... I can't be the... last!"" where it's made clear that the slayer isn't just the last of the slayers but the last living person on the planet. To make things more difficult, there is a chance this fic might have been one chapter of a multific, with each chapter exploring a different theme. :( My thought here are so vague it isn't even funny. Does anyone have any idea what story I'm talking about?	books	Marijn	1	1	NA	1	NA	0	NA	NA	1	NA	0	NA	0	0	1	NA	0	1	0	0	0	0	1	0	0	0	0	0	NA	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	1	0	0	1	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	NA	NA	NA	NA	NA

82599	Children's fantasy - boy & girl staying with farmer relative become embroiled in underground adventu	My recollection of reading this book in the 70's is very hazy. I remember a young boy & girl (brother & sister?) discovering an underground world while staying with their relatives on a farm (aunt and uncle?) They are drawn into a battle of good versus evil in which the farmer helps them (on the side of good, of course). It is just possible that the farmer was called Gabriel, but to the best of my knowledge there were no biblical or christian allegories intended. Just an exciting child's adventure story. The book would have been published before 1980 and most probably in the early/mid 1970's, although it could have been older. Any thoughts would be much appreciated.	books	Vivien	1	1	NA	0	NA	0	NA	NA	1	NA	0	NA	0	0	0	NA	1	1	1	0	0	0	1	0	0	0	0	1	NA	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	1	0	0	1	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	NA	NA	NA	NA	NA

24653	Prose poetry?	Hi everyone, This isn't about libraries per se, but please bear with me -- I couldn't think of a better group of people to ask this question than you all! :) I was just accepted to a selective writing tutorial at my school, and I'll be taking it in prose poetry. The tutorial is strongly student-driven, so I'm expected to come up with readings. Of course I have no idea where to start.  I'm looking for collections of microfiction, prose poetry, and (to some extent) just plain poetry that is beautiful, exciting, innovative, and thought-provoking. For poetry I've got some ideas, but the world of prose poetry/microfiction/whatever you want to call it is very new to me, and I don't really know what authors I ""should"" read, if any, or where I might start looking. Does anyone here have any suggestions for books I might try, or even how I might go about finding books to try?

122823	Airline Fiction	I recently spent a few hours in my local used bookshop looking for commercial aviation novels that have (pun intended) slipped under the radar - stuff other than that written by Block or Nance. I was pleased to unearth a number of interesting books. I'm currently reading ""Between the Thunder and the Sun"" by Alfred Coppel, which deals with a SFO to MIA flight that is hijacked during a hurricane. Here are some others: Flight 311 (Robert Neff) - A rough landing at Kai Tak and the aftermath Mayday 747 (Reynolds Locke) - The ""first novel of the jumbo jet age"" centers around a flight to London plagued with mechanical problems Hawks (Joseph Amiel) An airline up for purchase experiences a number of mysterious crashes Passengers (Michael Thomas and Laurence Foxworth) - New airliner has problems but is OKd for use The Higher They Fly (Christopher Hodder-Williams) - A transatlantic flight faces mechanical problems Airscream (John Bruce) - A crash and the legal outcome Flameout (Basil Jackson) - Investigation of a mysterious crash One that falls more into the crime fiction category is Operation Nightfall (John Miles and Tom Morris), which concerns a group of guys that hijack Atlanta International (yes, the entire airport).

73664	Moral Issues and Unreliable Narration in contemporary British fiction	Hi Guys, My summer reading was Zoe Heller's Notes on a scandal and A.L. Kennedy's Paradise which I can highly recommend. What is so fascinating about them is that throughout the novel the reader has to realise that the narrative is highly unreliable and it becomes hard to know what is, or isn't true... and it becomes even harder when you sympathise with the characters who have acted immorally. This is particularly the case in Heller's novel, where you stop caring about the act that the main character has done, and start to hate the narrator. I find it fascinating that contemporary British fiction can work in this way, and ""convince"" the reader that the things we read in the paper's (such as sexual affairs with minors) are not so bad, and that we can, through the narration, end up sympathising with the character. I would love to read more books like this, which address moral issues, or ethics, and where we, the readers, end up feeling sympathy for the wrong character through the narration. Does anyone have any recommedations? Thanks Sabrina	books	Toine	1	1	NA	0	NA	1	NA	NA	1	NA	0	NA	0	0	1	NA	0	1	0	0	0	0	1	0	0	0	0	1	NA	0	0	0	1	0	0	0	0	1	1	0	0	0	1	0	1	0	0	1	0	0	0	0	0	NA	NA	NA	NA	NA
53741	Need help with name and author	I read a book many (10-15 or more?) years ago and I would like to read it again. I know that there was a woman spending time alone sorting through her life. She was in the northeast (Cape Cod? Nantucket?) - I think in a house on a beach. One distinguishing feature that I do remember is that she either had been to or was planning to attend the annual meeting of the Modern Language Association (MLA), I believe in New York City. So I think she was some variety of an academic. If you don't know that one, but know of others with similar characteristics (especially woman taking time by herself in a house on the beach to figure out who she is and where she is going), I would be interested in those too.	books	Vivien	1	1	NA	0	NA	0	NA	NA	1	NA	1	NA	0	0	0	NA	0	1	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	1	NA	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	1	0	0	1	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	NA	NA	NA	NA	NA

22268	Children abducted for social experiment - kid's book 60s-70s	I'm looking for a book told from a perspective of a girl age ~12 who mysteriously (I can't remember the details) awakes in a weird school-type environment with other kids. They learn, eat, sleep, and do homework on a set schedule, but never have any contact with adults. Everything is automated and they just follow the schedule. It's not a bad life and our hero's academic performance improves, but she's understandably confused and wonders who is behind their situation.  At one point, the kids rebel - why are we here, anyway? - and they are punished with some sort of nerve gas that paralyzes them causes them to hear loud sounds and smell a horrible smell. They all behave, but the main character and one other child escape at the end of the novel and on their way out of the building read files that reveal details of the experiment.  I read this around 1988, but I don't remember it being particularly ""new."" I think it had to be published in the 60s or 70s, no later than 1985.  After a few years of thinking about it, I remembered the title - ""The Hawthorne Experiment."" That makes sense, because the Hawthone experiments dealt with the way the subjects of an experiement change their behavior when they know they've being observed. The only problem is that my memory must be wrong, unless it's not in the Library of Congress catalog.  I have been going crazy trying to figure this out for at least seven years. It's pretty obscure and this is a long shot, but if anyone can help, I will die of joy.

Recently, though, I picked up Nausea by Sartre, and then Gertrude by Hesse. I had been put off novels as a teen by the likes of Dickens, which I'm afraid to say didn't particularly resonate with me. But there is something appealing about these two books; and so I'm searching for books written in the same vein - first person, man alone in the city, psychological, philosophical. I've heard these modernist works are called ""city-novels"", but I'm struggling to find books in this style. A google search for ""city-novels"" is fruitless. An English novel would be preferable, but I understand this style is more French/German.	books	Vivien	1	0	NA	0	NA	0	NA	NA	1	NA	0	NA	0	0	0	NA	0	1	0	0	0	0	1	0	0	0	0	0	NA	0	0	0	1	0	0	1	0	0	1	0	0	0	1	0	1	0	0	0	1	0	1	1	0	NA	NA	NA	NA	NA

I'm an ESL/GED teacher, and a few years ago we had a book in the classroom on ""words not to say"" slang, profanities, etc - it was written particularly for people who are learning to speak English. The book mysteriously disappeared (!) and now I'm trying to find the title so I can order another copy. I've done keyword searches on Amazon and Google, and haven't come up with it yet.

35850	Modern Love Story Fiction?	I am a mostly non-reading male who has just encountered his thirties and would like to start reading for pleasure more often. I may be narrow-minded about what I am looking for in a b00000ook, but as I mentioned, I am a very infrequent reader and consider myself a beginner; you must like the activity for it to become a hobby. What I am looking for is something that I can relate to. I would like to find a fiction novel with a male perspective/narrator/main character, preferrably in the present or a relatively modern era, and about unrequited love- a subject I am all too familiar with. If there is such a novel, please let me know. Thank you.	books	Toine	1	1	NA	0	NA	0	NA	NA	0	NA	0	NA	0	1	1	NA	0	1	0	0	0	0	1	0	0	0	0	0	NA	0	0	0	1	0	0	0	0	0	1	0	1	1	1	0	1	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	NA	NA	NA	NA	NA

26265	Best books for reading Out Loud	When I was a kid, my mom and I would read books to each other in the car. As an adult, I am very lucky to have a life partner who enjoys listening to me read books out loud. So for most of my life, I have read and listened to books. I have found that not all books work well out loud, and there is a certain skill to choosing books that are going to be good out loud. What are some of your favorite out-loud books? As a kid, mom and I read each other all of the Little House on the Prairie books - young adult literature often works well out loud. As an adult, some of our favorite out-loud books have been Jonathan Strange and Mr. Norrell (I think it took us about 8 months to read it), The Princess Bride (that one took us about a week - we didn't get much sleep that week), The Once and Future King, and The Time Traveler's Wife. What criteria do you use when selecting books to read out loud? Some of our criteria are: * Length - really long books can get tedious out loud, so I usually don't want to tackle a book that is more than 350-400 pages (although there are lots of exceptions, such as Jonathan Strange and Mr. Norrell and The Adventures of Kavalier and Klay. * Fairly simple writing style - long sentences and complicated vocabulary can be hard to process aurally, so in general, a simple writing style works better. Again, there are lots of exceptions to this. This is why young adult literature often works well out loud. * Chapter lengths - since we tend to read out loud at bedtime, it's important to have regular stopping places. Books with fairly uniform chapter lengths, or lots of stopping places within the chapter, tend to work better. * Dialog style - I'm not very good at doing lots of different voices, so if the author doesn't put in a lot of ""he said / she said"", it can get really confusing for the person listening to me. Reading books out loud is a really amazing way to share the reading experience. We were both emotional wrecks while we were reading The Time Traveler's Wife, and it was wonderful to get to share the emotional trauma with someone else.  So what are some of your favorite books to read out loud? How do you choose which books you are going to read out loud? And what experiences have you had sharing books with someone else?	books	Vivien	1	0	NA	1	NA	0	NA	NA	0	NA	0	NA	1	0	0	NA	0	1	1	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	NA	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	1	1	1	0	1	0	0	0	1	0	1	0	0	NA	NA	NA	NA	NA

94761	Book about a ""silly / stupid family"" for older children -- this is a tough one!	My sister and I have been puzzling over this one for years. It's a book that dates to the 1960s or before, about a ""silly"" family (with the word silly or stupid in the title). The wife makes the husband do rather silly things to stave off danger, like during a rainstorm, standing in a tub of water, or standing on a chair in the closet in the dark while holding a wire hanger. She has a reason why he should do this, and he goes along. The book consists of separate chapters, each with a different such incident. It is illustrated with line drawings.  It was really funny to us when We read it as kids, and my sister read it to her kids in the 1980s as well. I have a sense that it could have been written before the 1960s, since ours was an older library copy. We think the words ""silly"" or ""stupid"" and ""family"" possibly were in the title, but aren't certain. I've done a number of google and LT searches to no avail.

101228	childrens/teen fantasy with role players from 80s	Hello! I'm trying to find the name of a fiction fantasy book that I read as a kid - I would have read it in the early 90's - but the book may have been older than that and from the 80s. I'm unsure if it would have been considered a teen book, (which is what age I was when I read it) or if it would be a children's chapter book.  The cover had two eyes and a clock, and was part of a series. I want to say it had midnight or twilight (or something conveying the same idea) in the title, but I don't know if it was the book or series title I'm thinking of.  The plot was about a group of tabletop role playing gamers who go into a house to act out the adventure in a haunted house. They search the house for various key items to complete a ritual, and the closer it becomes to midnight, the more real the events turn. The spirits in the house are actually people who tried this ritual in the past and failed, and have used the rpg as a vehicle to try and free themselves by taking possession of the players. There was also something about a bookkeeper who was turned into an octopus and forced to guard a special item. Funny the things we remember clearest heh.  Thank you for your time!

5444	Contemporary nonfiction about women's issues...	While I will be the first to say that every issue is a women's issue, there are issues that are of particular interest to women, issues that affect women's lives throughout the world (clearly I'm not telling any of you anything new here...). There are books addressing these ideas or issues which seek to challenge, educate, expand our understanding of them, or inspire us in some way. Some of these books end up in the women's studies section of the bookstore or libraries and some perhaps in other sections like sociology and history.  Excluding memoirs, which have a separate thread, and feminist classics, which certainly could have it's own thread; what contemporary nonfiction books on any idea or issue have you've read that you'd recommend?

70721	English Authors	Hello everyone,  The other day I realised that the majority of my library consists of novels by American authors, such as Stephen King, Jeffery Deaver, etc. and that only a few of the authors, of the books I've read, are English. J. K. Rowling, Joseph Delaney, Malcolm Rose, Conn Iggulden and Charlie Higson are literally the only English authors in my library.  Joseph Delaney was probably the most English author as he writes how he would speak, this is why alot of Americans think he isn't a good writer, mainly because they can't understand what it is he is talking about because the language is so...English! I would like to read more books by English authors because I am of course English. Are there any authors anybody could recommend? Preferably of a fantasy genre or thriller. ;) Thanks.	books	Marijn	0	0	NA	0	NA	0	NA	NA	0	NA	0	NA	0	0	0	NA	0	1	0	0	0	1	1	0	0	0	0	0	NA	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	1	0	1	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	NA	NA	NA	NA	NA

12075	Contemporary British fiction?	Many thanks to Bookbox for inviting me to this group! I was surprised to receive your message as I am not aware of a particular predilection for British writers although I do seem to read a fair few - probably not more than the average reader though. While I thoroughly enjoy the British ""classics"" or, I suppose, almost anything pre-1940ish, I am often left disappointed by contemporary British novels. For modern fiction I have found Latin American writers to be more consistently satisfying, and often extraordinary. I have also been pleasantly surprised by Indian authors, Canadians and immigrants / ex-pats of all kinds as well as a lot of literature in translation. I would like to read more recent British literature, particularly as one of my main sources of English reading matter at the moment is the British Council library at home in Caracas. Twenty years ago the library was well-stocked with British literature, from classics to poetry volumes, and was a pleasure to browse, but these days its stock is reduced to a few score of largely contemporary writers, many of whom I am unfamiliar with. So the purpose of this post is to ask which contemporary works (novels or short stories) members might recommend and why. Perhaps suggestions might be of use to others too. Amongst the newer British writers I have enjoyed are: Iain Banks (enjoyed his first several novels in the 1980s, but not sure I would want to read more recent ones - or would I?), Jane Gardam, Alex Garland (The Beach), Alasdair Gray (found Lanark exceptionally good, but others uneven), Mark Haddon (impressed by The curious incident of the dog in the night-time), Kazuo Ishiguro (stumbled upon him by chance 15 years ago and read most of his novels, finally realising he was English several years later!), Hanif Kureishi (The Buddha of Suburbia & The Black Album, but have not really enjoyed others), Ian McEwan, Graham Swift, Irving Welsh (Trainspotting, Filth, Marabou Stork Mightmares). I would appreciate any leads... many thanks, Chris. P.S. I have checked the other threads for names of authors, but any suggestions for particular books would be very welcome.	books	Mette	0	0	NA	0	NA	0	NA	NA	0	NA	0	NA	0	0	0	NA	0	1	0	0	0	1	1	0	0	0	0	1	NA	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	1	0	1	0	0	1	0	0	0	0	0	NA	NA	NA	NA	NA
64846	Adult fiction female jewel thief travels around europe/male cop steals paintings	There are two books from the same author about the same character - a female jewel thief (gemcutter?) who lives in France. I believe one book is about an emerald (crown jewel?). She might have a little dog. I can't remember any names or titles. I would like to read them again but am getting frustrated because I can't find them anywhere. There's also a cop who steals paintings and then returns them to the police station to show people how easy it is to break into their houses. At least one was new within the last 5 years, maybe.	books	Toine	1	1	NA	0	NA	0	NA	NA	1	NA	1	NA	0	0	0	NA	0	1	0	0	1	0	0	0	0	0	0	1	NA	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	1	0	0	1	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	NA	NA	NA	NA	NA
114185	Keep drugs illegal	Here is the deal. After decades of prohibition I believe that the War on Drugs has failed, and we need to pragmatically look at other options.  Not satisfied with this, I want to challenge my own opinion and try to understand the opposite viewpoint. However, every book I see pretty much agrees with that prohibition is a failure. What I would really like to know is if any of you out there can recommend an intelligent book or author that believes drugs should remain illegal? Any suggestions would be very welcome.	books	Maria	1	0	NA	0	NA	0	NA	NA	0	NA	0	NA	0	0	1	NA	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	NA	0	0	0	1	0	1	0	1	0	1	0	1	1	1	0	1	0	0	0	1	0	1	0	0	NA	NA	NA	NA	NA
115019	Historical YA time travel	I read a book in 2001 or 2002 about a young (high school age) couple who travel back in time to the medieval period. They're assumed to be married and have to share a bed and things get awwwwkward. The girl is captured by an evil villain who possibly wants to marry her and trap her in the medieval period forever. Oh, and she does magic! She might live in a shop with her grandmother in a 'she taught her everything she knows' way. The boy might be called Jared or something like that? Towards the end he fights the villain who captured the girl. If I remember correctly, his parents died, possibly in a car crash. I think they meet in science class, possibly when the boy gets so angry that something blows up, and she heals him. And at one point they're in a cafe with classmates and he ignores her and she gets annoyed. Does that sound familiar to anyone? The book was quite big and my paperback copy was greeny-gray coloured, I think the picture was of clouds or a storm, possibly with a castle on the front. I remember being absolutely in love with the book and would like to reread it to see if it's as good as I remember = Thanks for your help!	books	Toine	1	1	NA	0	NA	1	NA	NA	1	NA	0	NA	0	1	0	NA	0	1	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	1	0	1	NA	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	1	0	0	1	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	NA	NA	NA	NA	NA

44661	Recommendations sought on preindustrial cultural contacts	I am interested in migrations of peoples and cross cultural contacts including but not necessarily gene flow between groups. I am primarily interested in the history of preindustrial, ancient and prehistorical contacts among disparate groups. Instead of the predominating genetic approach today,am am looking for books about cultural exchanges between people, with evidence about the fact of and better yet the nature of the contact and its influence on the relevant societies.

17963	Recommended books for a twelve year old	My kid sister will be starting junior high in two weeks. Since my time there several years ago, the school has picked up a reading program. For a certain amount of time each day, everyone in the school is to be reading. (Even the high school has the program, so it won't just go away in two years.) My sister doesn't take to reading much, so I have a real challenge looking for some books that will interest her for the reading program. I've just spent a long time searching Barnes & Noble's website for something suitable, but am not coming up with much. Finally, I realized it was insane to continue the search, since some of you could probably recommend some great books. :) In the past, she has enjoyed joke books, some poetry, and R.L. Stine's Goosebumps series. She has ADHD, which may make reading more difficult for her than children without it.

131332	Looking for different fantasy books... [a long post and a plea]	Dear FantasyFans, I will... erm... abuse your goodwill a bit here. But stay with me, I want some suggestions and I think you can help me. After an year of travelling majorly through the kingdom of Historical Fiction, I am ready to return to Fantasy and VERY eager to do so. During my vacations I used my free time to go to both normal and second-hand bookstores looking for some good fantasy books to read. I must say that the Brazilian market does not offer the impressive diversity of the English one, but I try... Much to my disappointment, I could not come across a single nice book - not even in the English book shelves. Two problems: FIRST: All books had a very similar plot ""The evil demon/sorcerer/mysterious being X wants to conquer the kingdom of ABC. With his powers, he brings death, disease and fear to every town and village of ABC.  Meanwhile, hidden in the distant village of C, young and humble blacksmith/lumberjack/carpenter/inexperienced wannabe knight or wizard Z prepares to go off on a journey to rescue his father/mother/master/twin brother who was kidnapped by the hosts of Evil X, for mysterious reasons . His path will cross with that of the evil conqueror himself, who is also looking for the great scepter/sword/wand/crown/trident/spear of Light, the ultimate weapon that will help him to fulfill his wicked wishes. However, only the last heir of the dragon blood/vampire shadow/fairy glitter/elven sparkle is allowed to use the power of this magical whatever. How can Z rescue the person he loves and save ABC from total destruction????"" Okay... it's not such much the plot details that get repeated (I can live with that), but the flatness of most of the stories - they are just about Evil X being evil and hero Z being heroic. I like my fantasy with a bit more subtlety than that and suddenly it seems all new fantasy writers are channeling the same storytelling spirit. And it shocks me that many of these books come with these super-detailed maps full of towns and kingdoms, and yet all conflict resumes to Evil X trying to Rule da World. The author spends a time creating a whole new world and never breathes any life into it. It's as if the world was there simply because Evil X needs something to conquer and destroy and because Hero Z has to be born somewhere. It drives me nuts. SECOND: One story = 10 books I love series - GOOD series. I do. When a series is good, I'll read it with great pleasure. But nowadays it seems every author thinks he/she can write a series. So there we go, people writing book with the plots I stated above AND making it last for 6 books. Or more.  I really wish I could find some nice one-shot fantasy books, because I don't always feel like engaging in a long-term commitment with one series. I have a pile of books to read and only one lifetime. But one-shots are now like Dodos and Dinosaurs. Every single fantasy book I find no matter how CRAPPY it is is part of an in-progress trilogy or is ""Book 6 in the Scepter/Sword/Wand/Crown/Trident/Spear of Light series"". Not every story has what it takes to survive for more than a book. Yet survive they do. The English book session of my favorite bookstore is not that small and yet I could NOT find any one-shot book to read. Or a series that had an engrossing different tale, even if some of IT followed the plot line I described above. I grew tried of looking. *sigh* I apologize for the rant. I just am tired of picking up book hoping they'll improve and finding the were so similar to the two last fantasy books I read that I start to mix up the characters. And I have a good memory for names.  I have been tempted to start Game of Thrones series because so many people are loving it, but the fact it's a series that hasn't ended yet (and who knows when will that happen) and that each book has 900 pages with bible-style thin paper and small font-size made me feel a bit lazy. There is also the fact that the Game of Thrones books cost an exorbitance here. I'd love to read a good one-shot fantasy book right now, or a book that is a part of a bigger series but can be read as an one-shot. In the past, these were not so uncommon...  I'd love some recommendations from other readers. I know my long rant must have annoyed some of you, but it my hope that some will sympathize with my cause. I am willing to order books from abroad, as long as they have a nice story and well-written. So, if you can give me some ideas of fantasy books that do not fall into the two traps I described above, please post below. I'll be grateful and will no longer have the time to post long rants like this one! ;) Thank you in advance!

96190	Best Dystopian and/or Cyberpunk fiction	Looking for some library recommendations, and even the sci-fi folks at the bookstore couldn't help me! So I'm turning to all of my lovely fellow LibraryThingians. :D As the title suggests, I'm looking for some excellent dystopian fiction. I'm on a dystopian kick right now, and I've read all of the well-known ones. And I'm really into cyberpunk, a la Cory Doctorow. As much as I like Docotorow's concepts, I have a difficult time getting into his writing style. So anything that's technological sci-fi, or even more medical/genetics sci-fi, would be great.

121286	Children's Fiction--princess(?), woodland path, animal helpers	Hello; I am searching for a book that I read as a child, probably circa 1990 give or take a few years. I remember it was a small hardcover book with a picture of a wood and a path, and girl with long blond hair travelling along the path. It seems to me the plot had something to do with her trying to get to the end of the path for some quest like adventure, and she had animal friends who helped her. I am sorry that is all I have! Hopefully someone will be able to show me the cover--I think that would be the most helpful!	books	Maria	1	1	NA	0	NA	1	NA	NA	1	NA	0	NA	0	0	0	NA	0	1	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	1	0	1	NA	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	1	0	0	1	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	NA	NA	NA	NA	NA
27625	Teen book girl being brainwashed by aunt and uncle	I read this book probably about twenty years ago and can't remember the name of the book or the author. An orphaned girl lives happily with her Aunt until one day the Aunt marries some really creepy man. They go to live in his house where he has three daughters from his first marriage. These daughters never leave the house or go to school and the man has brainwashed the Aunt into his way of thinking, which I think is some weird cross between an extreem religion and a desire to protect and control his children. The girl wants a normal life and tries to escape, even to the point of getting out and begging the neighbours to help her but the Aunt and Uncle catch her and tell the neighbours she is mentally disabled and not to pay her any attention. Eventually the middle daughter (who I think is called Helen) becomes caught up in the girl's description of real life, friends, school etc and agrees to help her. The girl pretends to be coming around to the Uncle's way of thinking and is eventually allowed to leave the house in the company of his daughters. They go jogging late at night for exercise with a cover story of looking for a lost puppy. This is how the girl and Helen escape. I'm not sure if that's how it ends or just all I can remember but I'm trying to replace my old books and this was one that got away somehow but that I would like to track down.	books	Marijn	1	1	NA	0	NA	0	NA	NA	1	NA	0	NA	0	0	0	NA	0	1	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	1	NA	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	1	0	0	1	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	NA	NA	NA	NA	NA

113543	YA/Child - a book about a girl and her mum who own an antique shop and a strange boy that comes to w	Hi, I'm looking for this book about a girl and her mum who own an antique shop, and a strange boy comes to work for them, telling the loveliest yarns about their antiques to customers.  First (I think), a grandfather clock that was owned by a fatalistic irishman, whose belief in his fated death led to it; and then something about a jewellery box (?) in India... Basically, he managed to come up with colourful stories that made their antiques sell well, but this didn't go down well with the girl/her mum who had a policy of not lying.. and then it started turning out each of the stories was true.. And in the end, the boy turned out to be a lonely author getting lost in his book and the girl and her mum were characters therein... I've been racking my mind for a while but can't come up with anything... other than *I think* it was a female author..	books	Marijn	1	1	NA	0	NA	0	NA	NA	1	NA	0	NA	0	0	0	NA	0	1	1	0	0	1	0	0	0	0	0	0	NA	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	1	0	0	1	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	NA	NA	NA	NA	NA

Here's what he knows about it...it appeared on some ""Top 200"" book list although he's not sure which one. It's vaguely about WWII and the Pacific. It could be based on the author's own experience, but he thinks that it's literature and not an autobiography. It might have been published in the 1950s, but he's really not sure.  Vague eh? It was a book an exgirlfriend recommended and they are no longer are terms for him to be able to ask her.  I can only come up with Norman Mailer's ""The Naked and the Dead"" or ""The Caine Mutiny.""

92996	YA SciFi. Teen genious with military moves.	I read this novel about 8 to 10 years ago. It may have been a novella. Not sure. Anyway, it takes place somewhere in space and in the somewhat far future. Teenage boy works for government doing stuff on a computer creating virtual moves so the army can move ahead and accomplish those moves. The teenager has a relationship with some teen female, they have some love story. This is a guess, but I can't remember too well, I think they try to run away at some point with some friends of theirs. Also, the novel is first person perspective, in the boy's view. No idea what any of the names for the characters were. At some points, the words were italicized, and the boy would narrate the time. That's all I can think of right now, also, the cover, I remember was either orange or red with a grid looking thing on it. Maybe even yellow. Please help if you can.

74255	YA Fiction, 7-9 years ago, Boy is bored & taken away to a magical house, four seasons in a day, can'	I really can't remember much about this Book, it just popped into my head and I really want to find it now. I'm not even sure whether I actually read it or dreamt it haha. anyway... How I remember it: A Young boy either  a) fights with his mother and is in his room angry at her b) Is just bored on school holidays in his room (I get the feeling this is set in England) A crazy man comes in either: a) by flying through the window b) or appearing with a ""pop"" The man offers the boy a life of fun and freedom the boy accepts. They then travel to a house of some sort where there are all four seasons in a day. As I remember it he loves it there then sinister undertones are revealed and the boy begins to miss his family. He tries to escape but everytime he goes through the gate it simply leads him back to the house through some sort of magic. In the end he escapes using some sort of rope or sling shot contraption.  It's really sad in the end because he only stays there for about 10 days but on the outside world that is equivalent to 10 years and his parents have put out missing persons posters and stuff and he has been missing for the whole time.  Ring a bell anyone??  Like I said I probably made a lot of these details up.

108344	Does this book sound familiar? (Trying to find a book)	If I'm duplicating another book thread, please forgive me... I went through the threads in this group but didn't see one for this. I remember a movie that I watched when I was little... maybe 7 or 8 (I'm 30 now!). It was back when CBC showed Disney-type movies Sundays at 7pm... Anyhow, I think it might have been based on a book and I am interested in getting it for my girls. The basic plot: The family was Vietnamese/Laotian/Cambodian and came to America after being sponsored by a church group, I believe. They stayed with another family and I remember them being very shy and not wanting to lie on the beds, or explore etc. They had a little girl who was the main character and she was braver than the others. I think she eventually learned English well enough to be some sort of a ""super-student"" in spelling or something like that. It's not the book by Ann M. Martin where they adopt a little girl and she ends up being a better student than her older sister. Someone recommended that one and I got it - nice story but not the one I'm thinking of. Any and all help would be greatly appreciated. I don't even remember who was in the movie or else I would research it from that angle!	books	Vivien	1	0	NA	0	NA	0	NA	NA	1	NA	1	NA	0	0	0	NA	0	1	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	1	NA	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	1	0	0	1	0	0	1	0	1	0	1	NA	NA	NA	NA	NA

52171	Magic flutes and druids?	I've got these random memories of a book I read probably fifteen years ago bouncing around in my head, and I'd at least like to know I didn't make it up, if not find a copy and reread it. I can't remember much except random details. It was either a children's or YA thing. It was about a culture that seemed semi druid like. The main character was a child (I forget if it was a boy or a girl) who was about eight or nine who got either kicked out of her village or went off on some kind of a quest. At some point he acquires this magic instrument, either an ocarina or flute, I think. Sorry, I know this isn't very good, but its been a long time since I read this. I think there was a videogame or something connected to it as well, because I can remember images on a screen including standing in a cave trying to pick out a melody on a clef at the bottom of the screen. IDK, maybe I made the whole thing up.	books	Marijn	1	1	NA	0	NA	0	NA	NA	1	NA	0	NA	0	0	0	NA	0	1	1	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	1	NA	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	1	0	0	1	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	NA	NA	NA	NA	NA

131328	Occult Fiction	Last year I read the following books: - The Sea Priestess by Dion Fortune - Moon Magic by Dion Fortune - The puppet master by Liz Greene And I really liked them! Even since I have been looking for other book of GOOD occult fiction, but haven't found any. The books I come across are either plain fantasy (even if they happen in the modern world) or thriller involving vampires, satanic rituals and secret societies. None of the have the subtle occultism and mysticism that the books above have... I was wondering if anyone could give me some recommendations in the comments for books to look out for? Thank you in advance! :)	books	Maria	1	0	NA	0	NA	0	NA	NA	0	NA	0	NA	0	0	1	NA	0	1	0	0	0	1	1	0	0	0	0	0	NA	0	1	0	1	0	1	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	1	0	1	0	0	1	1	0	1	0	0	NA	NA	NA	NA	NA
19025	Amsterdam	Recently I went to Amsterdam - lovely city, of course - and now I want to read some books set there. I've bought The Green Face by Gustav Meyrink and The Discovery of Heaven by Mulisch and look forward to immerse myself. I also read MacLean's Puppet on a Chain years ago, maybe I should reread it, and the Franka comic books sometimes display an Amsterdam setting...  Anyone got further suggestions for great books set in Amsterdam that give you a feel for the city?	books	Maria	1	0	NA	0	NA	0	NA	NA	0	NA	1	NA	0	0	0	NA	0	1	0	0	0	1	0	0	0	0	0	0	NA	0	1	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	1	0	1	0	0	1	0	0	0	0	0	NA	NA	NA	NA	NA

116997	children's book about a girl and a welsh dragon with no name	Hi All, I'm looking for the title of a book, or maybe a series of books, that I read as a child - would probably have been late 70s, maybe early 80s at a push. It was about a girl who went on holiday to Wales (UK) and found a friendly dragon living in a cave on the beach. She brought him food (he was always hungry, usually a bun or something) and he told her his name so she could call him whenever she was in trouble. The best thing was though his name was never mentioned in the story, so it was a secret. Lots of adventures followed, although I can't remember any of them. I also recall something about not running around a rock three times anticlockwise because that would summon up a witch - which of course the little girl did and then had to be rescued. I have very fond memories of the story and would love to find it again - although maybe that's a bad idea as it will never be as i remember it from childhood. All suggestions gratefully received.	books	Toine	1	0	NA	0	NA	0	NA	NA	1	NA	1	NA	0	0	0	NA	0	1	1	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	1	NA	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	1	0	0	1	0	0	1	0	0	0	1	NA	NA	NA	NA	NA

71339	October Group Read - ghoulies and ghosties - recommendations	I'd like to start this recommendation thread early, because I am having problems coming up with potential reads.  For some reason, I can easily think of a large number of Japanese books which would fit, from older/more traditional stuff such as the stories collected and translated by Lafcadio Hearn (or other collections like Tales of Moonlight and Rain), to modern tales like Strangers by Taichi Yamada. My research has also discovered that there is a whole subgenre of supernatural manga (eg Pet Shop Of Horrors).  Other possibilities I've found are: Strange Tales From A Chinese Studio, a collection of old Chinese ghost stories The Square Moon, modern Arabic supernatural tales The Secret History of Moscow and other books by Ekaterina Sedia, and The Night Watch and other books by Sergei Lukyanenko (Russian, modern fantasy) But I am sure there must be lots more out there - whether that's traditional/folk stories or more modern chillers.

99309	Politics of Multiculturalism Recommendations?	I'm new, and would appreciate any recommended reading on the politics of multiculturalism. Parekh's Rethinking Multiculturalism: Cultural Diversity and Political Theory (which I just finished) in the end left me unconvinced, though I did find much of value I thought he depended way too much on being able to talk out the details later. It may be that I found his writing style really irritating so adopted a defiant skepticism, but still... Anyway, I've read Sen, Rawls, Habermas, and Nussbaum, still don't feel like I've wrapped my little brain around the issue very well and would appreciate any suggestions for further anyone might offer.	books	Marijn	1	0	NA	0	NA	0	NA	NA	0	NA	0	NA	1	0	1	NA	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	NA	0	0	0	1	0	1	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	1	0	1	0	0	1	0	0	0	0	0	NA	NA	NA	NA	NA
129317	Science Fiction, probably 1970s	It would be great if someone could ID this book that keeps niggling at me. (Don't you hate when that happens?) There were two alien species. One was very aggressive and drafted skilled workers from a more peaceful species onto large spaceships. The ships also had a population of the peaceful species that called themselves ship bred or ship born. The POV is mostly a ship born female. They used implants for inter-species communications. The very aggressive species set aside sections of the ship for raising their own young and were even unpredictable and explosively violent near that area. The female overlord-type running one ship drafted a technician, implanted him, paired him with the POV female of his species. Then she bought a human spacer out of lot of wild humans and added him to the group and ordered the other two to see if they could come to understand him. Along the way, there was a planetary invasion/destruction, because the humans had on it didn't immediately comply the demands of the overlord-types. The POV female discovered she was unable to function under an open sky. The implanted human insisted on rescuing a human child, much to the bafflement of the other two species. There was a rival ship, run by a male overlord-type, that also picked up some humans and wound up putting a mother and her child in the nesting area because they didn't have any children of their own species. The two ships came together and established some sort of alliance/relationship.  The book had a Cherryh feel in that it threw you into alien cultures without much explanation, but it isn't one of hers. Any suggestions would be appreciated.	books	Marijn	1	1	NA	0	NA	0	NA	NA	1	NA	1	NA	1	0	0	NA	1	1	0	0	0	1	1	0	0	0	0	1	NA	0	0	0	1	0	0	1	0	0	1	0	0	0	1	0	0	1	0	1	0	0	0	0	0	NA	NA	NA	NA	NA

20684	books on marriage	I just got engaged about a week and a half ago, and I'm looking for recommendations on books about marriage. Not self-help or how-to manuals, or ""how to plan a wedding"" type books. They can be fiction or non-fiction. Just anything that maybe looks at marriage in a different way, or a book that really nails what marriage is about. I've already read a couple of books on marriage that were interesting: Marriage: A History - talks about how marriage went from being all about property and obedience to being about love, and how the divorce rate reflects this. The Other Woman: Twenty-one Wives, Lovers, and Others Talk Openly About Sex, Deception, Love, and Betrayal - not the most positive book to read, but definitely interesting. Dupont Circle: A Novel - I came across this at Kramerbooks in DC and picked it up for a few reasons. Number one, we were there on a trip and I always buy a book as a souvenir. And since I was in Dupont Circle, it seemed appropriate. Secondly, it's about marriage, and we got engaged while in DC. The book focuses on three different couples, including one gay couple and the laws/issues regarding gay marriage.  I also have A History of the Wife on my TBR list. I look forward to hearing some recommendations!	books	Maria	1	0	NA	0	NA	0	NA	NA	0	NA	0	NA	0	0	1	NA	0	1	0	0	0	1	1	0	0	0	0	0	NA	0	1	0	1	0	1	0	0	0	0	0	1	1	1	0	1	0	0	1	1	0	1	0	0	NA	NA	NA	NA	NA

45571	Are there works in Latin with English translations?	I'm taking Latin classes and I thought it would be helpful (more so entertaining) to find some Latin works IN Latin with English translations also given. I tried Amazon but nothing really came up. Does anyone know any books like this? I'd really like to get Ovid's Metamorphoses in Latin with English translations, but I might just get it in Latin and buy a translated version. I do love Charles Martin's translation as well as cover art. Thanks.	books	Marijn	0	0	NA	0	NA	0	NA	NA	0	NA	0	NA	0	0	0	NA	0	1	0	0	0	0	0	1	0	0	0	0	NA	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	1	0	1	0	0	1	0	0	0	0	0	NA	NA	NA	NA	NA

69314	Best of the Golden Era	Seeing as though everyone loves poll threads, what are the best books from the Golden Era of SF? (since this is the ""Early Science Fiction"" group, will be presumed to be from 1930 to the end of 1959, as per the group description). Here's what I came up with: Demolished Man, Alfred Bester (1953) Stars My Destination, Alfred Bester (1955) Childhood's End, Arthur C Clarke (1953) The Space Merchants, Frederik Pohl and C. M. Kornbluth (1953) Star Maker, Olaf Stapledon (1937) A Canticle for Leibowitz, Walter M Miller Jr. (1959) Obviously, everyone will think I am wrong, but I suppose that is what makes these fun.

110196	Historical Fiction: Romans and Gauls or Celts (90s)	Read a book in the mid-90's about the Romans meeting either the Gaults or the Celts. I don't remember which group. I do remember a soldier, it may have been someone important, interacting with a teen or young Gallic/Celtic woman. The story was fictional, and I believe there were romantic overtones between the woman and the soldier. There might have been a druid storyline, but what I remember was the girl main character, and that there was conflict between her people and the Roman empire.

104756	fiction set during Jesus' time	I read this book in 1999 in 8th grade for a middle school academic decathlon. I can't remember title or author. All I know is that it was set around the time Jesus lived and was about to be crucified. The main character lived alone with his sister. I think both of their parents died already. If I remember correctly, his sister was disabled in some way... not sure. He was really protective of her. A roman soldier or something came by to see his sister a lot, which really pissed him off. I think later he joined some kind of cult or rebellion. I remember Jesus being a minor character in the book (not sure if he had lines), but still significant in some way to the group that the main character joined.  I can't remember if the book was religious or not. I do remember the main character being really cynical about everythign but eventually loosening up with regard to his sister and the roman soldier.  Does this sound familiar to anyone? if it helps, this book was required for the jr high school academic decathlon for anyone who did the literature section in 1999. I greatly enjoyed the book and would appreciate any help towards finding it. Thanks.	books	Maria	1	1	NA	0	NA	0	NA	NA	1	NA	0	NA	0	1	0	NA	0	1	1	0	0	0	1	0	0	0	0	1	NA	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	1	0	0	1	0	0	1	0	0	0	1	NA	NA	NA	NA	NA
113878	Dispensational theology?	Ive read very little about Dispensational Theology vs. Covenant Theology. I read a book many years ago by Kim Riddlebarger, A Case for Amillennialism, and while I found the book a little disorganized, I found its overall argument quite compelling, and have ever since considered myself Amil. (Incidentally Ive had Michael Hortons God of Promise on my wishlist ever since then and havent ever gotten around to reading it, so Im not sure I really know enough about Covenant Theology to identify myself with that position.) However, Ive recently been challenged by a friend to reconsider Dispensational Theology. Now I know the seminal work on Dispensational Theology is probably Lewis Sperry Chafers four-volume Systematic Theology, but I'm not exactly in the mood for that kind of heavy reading. Can anyone recommend a good relatively digestible book in support of Dispensationalism? I'd like to get an idea of what their best arguments are.  Bonus question: if anyone can recommend a better book on Covenant Theology than Hortons, Id be interested in that, too.	books	Vivien	1	0	NA	0	NA	0	NA	NA	0	NA	0	NA	0	0	1	NA	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	NA	0	0	0	1	1	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	1	0	1	0	0	0	1	0	1	0	0	NA	NA	NA	NA	NA
9486	Favorite YA Fantasy books	Okay, I am a sixth grade science teacher and a few years back I took a liking to YA Fantasy. I seem to be somewhat of a fanatic, it's all I read these days. Some of my favorites to date. Abarat by Clive Barker, and Abarat, Days of Magic, Nights of War. These are amazing books with a fantastic new world. One of the neat things about these books is the art. Barker created all the art found in these books and they really add to the story. Make sure if you pick up a copy to get the ones with the art. I am patiently waiting for book 3, coming out who knows when. The Underland Chronicles by Suzanne Collins. I have read the first two in this series and they are really fast, fun reads.  The Bartimaeus Trilogy by Jonathan Stroud. Here two I have finished just the first two books, but they are great.  The Icemark Chronicles by Stuart Hill. The second book just came out a month or so ago and I am currently reading the Blade of Fire. This one has not only some really good battles, but a great alliance of man, werewolf, giant snow leopards, and vampires. Very goo writing.  All right, I could go on and on, but what are some others. I am allways looking for new titles to exploare. Take care.	books	Toine	1	0	NA	0	NA	1	NA	NA	1	NA	0	NA	0	0	0	NA	1	1	0	0	0	0	1	0	0	0	0	0	NA	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	1	0	1	0	0	1	0	0	0	0	0	NA	NA	NA	NA	NA

34895	Before the da vinci code there was this book..HELP	I bought the book in 2001 I believe, in paperback, professor thinks he has found the secret to the puzzle box that contains the holy grail, which is a scroll, he sends computer disks to his daughter for her to keep safe. He is murdered and She takes disks to Scotland to meet a guy to help her (dad mentions this guy), They go to England churches and libraries searching for these clues , with a brief visit to France. They are being chased by a group of Templar knights who belive they have the right to the puzzle box because they are descendants of the original Knights of the round table. This book is unusual in that every other chapter tells the story of the puzzle thru history, touching on Egyptian , Greek, Chinese mythology until it brings the history to modern day. I have searched and searched until fingers sore and foot weary. I have book by book searched titles at local bookstore.

9680	Best Survey of Jewish History	I've read two: A History of the Jews by Paul Johnson, and Jews, God, History by Max Dimont.

124350	Lesbian Author Suggestions for Library Stock	The library authority I work for seems keen on stocking a good selection of lesbian-themed fiction, as I have noticed a lot of titles published by Bold Strokes (they have a very distinctive house design style, so are easy to spot on the shelves).  While this is laubable, a lady came in the other day looking for Rita Mae Brown's Rubyfruit Jungle. Not only did we not have a copy of this - to be fair, it appears to be out of print in the UK - but we don't have a single other Rita Mae Brown title, not only in our library, but the entire region. I've reported this stock gap, so hopefully we'll get something in, but it's led me to wondering which other authors in the field of lesbian fiction we should really be stocking. Not so much names such as Virginia Woolf, who is an established literary name we always have in stock somewhere in the system.

120144	Searching for title/author of mystery/detective/romantic suspense novel	I'm trying to find a book that I read at long ago -- in part, because I want to read it again and figure out why I still remember bits and pieces of it all these years later. I believe that I read it in hard cover, so may well have gotten it from the library. Here's all I can remember: Category: Mystery, Detective, or Romantic Suspense Setting: A country in Africa (I believe -- I'm fairly certain that it was not set in India) Time -- I remember it as being colonial. I think that the police detective was a British inspector assigned there or perhaps had grown up there But I read it in the 1970s/80s. So, no idea if I was reading an older book or a book set in the past. Or perhaps it was post-colonial. I am fairly certain that this was not a book in a series. I liked it and would have read the rest of the series. And although there was a mystery/detective plot involving a murder, it might have been classified as romantic suspense. The female protagonist was a young woman (perhaps a governess, perhaps a traveling companion, or poor relation). She had come to a house (perhaps a plantation or farm) where this murder involving the family and neighbors occurred. I don't remember who the victim was, there may have been more than one. What I do remember is that at the end of the book, the young woman has gone home to England, there is a knock at the door, and it is the inspector (who has fallen in love with her). It was told in third person, may have had multiple viewpoints.  I know this is all a bit vague. I've had various suggestions. As far as I can tell, it isn't a Elspeth Huxley novel.	books	Marijn	1	1	NA	0	NA	0	NA	NA	1	NA	1	NA	1	1	0	NA	0	1	0	0	0	1	1	0	0	1	0	1	NA	0	0	0	1	0	0	0	0	0	1	0	1	1	1	0	0	1	0	1	0	0	0	0	0	NA	NA	NA	NA	NA

36108	looking for a book I read as a kid	I'm in search of a book I read as a kid.... It is a childrens picture book, I'm guessing it was probably published in the late 1960's, its about two sisters that share a bedroom. The younger sister puts a jump rope in the middle of the room to divide it only to realize she has given her sister the door to get out on her side of the room. The girl imagines having all these children and a horse in the room and visitors arriving in a basket through the window...at the end I think they wind up making up and going to play ""jump rope"" together. The pictures in the book were sort of sketched and they were mostly black and white, the girl had braids and freckles. If anyone remembers this book, I would be so happy I have been looking for years and I know my copy is long gone after all its use.

126740	autobiographical-travels of two young french men	hello. i'm trying to remember the name of a book i began reading a year or two ago. it is an account of the travels of two young french men. did they travel by motorcycle? car? was this perhaps pre cars? it might have been pre world world war II, although i think after world war I. one of the men was an artist and i think this was the genesis for the travels which took them to macedonia, maybe? perhaps near northern africa? greece? poland? the one recounting the travels became a journalist i think (or maybe was just a writer). i think the gist of the book was the two men had just finished or were finishing their studies and this was a time before they had any real responsibilities and the freedom they felt exploring the edges of europe. i think the artist had an offer to show his work somewhere random (yugoslavia/macedonia) and that is where the journey began. it might have been post world war II and pre vietnam but i am not thinking that is correct.	books	Maria	1	1	NA	0	NA	0	NA	NA	1	NA	1	NA	0	1	0	NA	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	NA	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	1	0	0	1	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	NA	NA	NA	NA	NA

123460	Wanted: Good YA fantasy that is NOT ""urban"" or contemporary	Even though I'm getting quite a bit of age on me, I enjoy a good YA read once in a while. I once heard a speaker address the question, ""What's the difference between YA and adult fantasy?"" and then give a simple one-word answer -- ""Hope."" It's this hope, this acknowledgement that human/alien/Other nature may have a bright side as well as a dark side, that makes a refreshing change. (I'm plowing through ""A Song of Fire and Ice"" as we speak, and while I'm relishing it, I'd also welcome a counterbalance to its despair.) However, I've also discovered that, aside from Harry Potter, I don't really care much for fantasy set in contemporary times, particularly ""urban fantasy."" I prefer a period (WW II or previous) or a mythical setting. I'd like to see my YA heroes and heroines fighting magical battles, but I'm not so keen on seeing them forced to navigate the mean corridors of the modern high school. It's a milieu in which I'd rather not spend much time. Yet I've noticed that among the new YA releases, nine out of ten are contemporary or ""urban"" fantasy. So maybe you guys know some good titles that don't follow that tide. Here's what I'm looking for: 1) Again, a setting other than contemporary. Futuristic is okay but not preferred. Steampunk is definitely acceptable. But mythic is preferred above all else. 2) Both male and female characters given importance in the story, treated with sympathy, and given the chance to act heroically. I'm not interested in books that bash the guys, just as I'm not interested in books that sideline the gals.  3) Romance is okay but not essential. I prefer love stories when they are a part, but not the whole, of the protagonist's journey.	books	Marijn	1	1	NA	0	NA	0	NA	NA	1	NA	1	NA	0	1	0	NA	0	1	1	0	0	0	1	0	0	0	0	0	NA	0	0	0	1	0	0	1	0	0	0	0	0	0	1	0	1	0	0	1	0	0	0	0	0	NA	NA	NA	NA	NA
35182	Favorite Patricia Cornwell Book	Do you have a personal favorite book of hers? Do you like to go back and reread her books again? Is it best to just pick up any book of hers or start at the beginning and read them in the order she wrote originally wrote them? Because I am just starting with Black Notice and I will probably just pick another book of hers to read at random whenever I finish reading this one. beatles1964	books	Marijn	0	0	NA	0	NA	0	NA	NA	0	NA	0	NA	0	0	0	NA	0	1	0	0	0	1	0	0	0	0	0	0	NA	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	1	0	0	0	1	1	0	0	0	0	0	NA	NA	NA	NA	NA
40380	Roots and a little girl named Andromeda	Years ago, I was in someone's car and they were playing this book-on-tape, and I liked the story, but I can't remember for the life of me what it was. It had something to do with a little girl named Andromeda getting stuck in this hole and these roots surrounded her, and the whole thing was orchestrated by her mother for money or something. I think she eventually got back at her mother once she was an adult. I don't know.	books	Marijn	1	1	NA	0	NA	0	NA	NA	1	NA	0	NA	0	0	0	NA	0	1	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	1	NA	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	1	0	0	1	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	NA	NA	NA	NA	NA

109493	YA SciFi with ""energy particle"" alien who visits boy	I read this YA SciFi book in sometime around the late 80s or early 90s. The protagonist boy gets visited by an alien who takes the form of energy particles that are like static and the boy can feel them as tingles. The first time they ""meet"" is in the boy's bedroom at night. There is a scene early on where the boy is walking down his driveway in the winter and realizes he has been floating because he has not left any footprints in the snow (the alien made him float somehow). Eventually, the alien takes the boy on the spaceship (which I believe has a transparent floor or wall so he can see space) and they go to a planet (might be the moon, not sure about that). Unfortunately, I don't remember much else about it.

5370	Nonfiction for College Freshmen	The major project I assign in my Freshman Comp II course is a research project that begins with the students having to read a work of non-fiction each chooses from a list I give them. I try to keep things on the list that will shake them up a bit, make them question their basic assumptions (I live in a very conservative area and thus my students have come from conservative backgrounds), and that offer an argument based on evidence and reason rather than ""values.""  For many (most) students, this will be the first entire book they've read. (Yes, it's very upsetting.) I update my list over Christmas break and am about to begin that process, so if anyone has read any stimulating, solid non-fiction in this last year and would like to make recommendations, I'd love to hear them.

68695	Kant's moral theory and a priori	Hello all. I'm interested to know if anyone can suggest books or articles devoted to criticism of the a priori foundation of Kant's moral theory. I'm finding the solution untenable based on my notion of what is generally thought about a priori (even considering Kant's earlier work) and I'm not convinced that his treatments of the good will, duty, and the hypothetical/categorical imperatives address the situation. What is it about morality that can be pointed to that is a priori? I remain confused. And it's noted even in the Stanford Encyclopedia of Philosophy that Kant vacillated concerning whether morality really has an a priori 'component' or if it's based upon experience. I am preferring the latter and would like to read more about this. Also, I would love to read comments about this even if they're telling me I'm missing something obvious.

55722	Science fiction, man trapped in a ""time box"" (?), lots of push-ups and sit-ups	I've been trying to figure this out for years. I recall reading a science fiction novel (or possibly short story) where a main plot element was a man (boy?) trapped in some type of box/container/cell where the flow of time was altered. From his perspective time moved normally, but the outside world was standing still. I feel like he was trapped for at least a year, during which time he had nothing to do but eat some kind of protein bars and do lots of exercises like push-ups and sit-ups. I think he was plotting to get even with someone upon his release. The book was almost certainly published in the 70s or 80s. I appreciate any clues you might have.

14724	Contemporaries...	I need some direction for contemporary romance. I've been on a Kleypas/Quinn/Enoch kick for a while, and I don't want to get burned out. But let me just tell you, I am almost terrified of contemporary romance.  I know I like Susan Elizabeth Phillips. I also liked the Aphrodite series by Julie Kenner, but those are more fantasy as they generally have superheroes in them.  I keep up with Rachel Gibson, but she's hit or miss.  I'm not a Nora fan, as I've mentioned before. Maybe she's like fine wine--you have to acquire the taste... Anyway, who would you all put in league with SEP and RG as far as contemporaries go, that I might not know about yet?

64131	*Help! Need Book Suggestions!	A friend of mine has asked me the following question (I've slightly edited his note to me) and I thought I'd put it out here and see what you all might be able to suggest (or any comments you have on the subject). He's interested in books or short fiction. This might be a question more for some of the genre readers but perhaps not...  In The Fall of the House of Usher a house manifests the mental and physical state of the family that lives in it. In The Haunting of Hill House, the house arguably reacts to the main character's mental state--it manifests her psychosis. (snip) In Viator, a similar exchange takes place between a salvage crew and ship they're salvaging. What other literary examples can you think of that uses this device?	books	Vivien	1	0	NA	0	NA	0	NA	NA	0	NA	0	NA	1	0	0	NA	0	1	0	0	0	0	1	0	0	0	0	0	NA	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	1	0	1	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	NA	NA	NA	NA	NA
88147	2010 fantasy	I just posted this to a fantasy forum I don't think I can actually post to, but in case it worked, please forgive me for the cross-posting. I work in a library, but I don't buy the books. Lately, it seems like all the fantasy we are buying are edgy urban fantasies (with required belly shirt on cover, or long black coat, or both) and vampire or zombie books. I am sure they do a lively business, but I don't want to read them. When I asked our buyers for some nice old-fashioned fantasy, they challenged me to find some. My office mate and I have tried a lot of fantasy book sites and are coming up dry. So I am turning to the collective brain. It is shaping up to be a good Young Adult Fantasy year--but not such a good one for Adults. Since I am the one asking, I like male protagonists and likable, well developed characters and no elves or werewolves or gods or the like.

49738	Ancillary works	Hi. I've been a devotee of AAJW for more than 20 years. But I've never been able to attend a workshop. So I've had to try to teach myself the method using Ira Progoff's book, which is wonderfully comprehensive, but pretty turgid prose. I keep looking for a summary or something written by a Workshop leader, giving a brief explanation of all the major steps and a simple overview of how to proceed and what to aim for. I don't know whether Dialogue House has a monopoly on such things or it simply hasn't occurred to anyone to extrapolate from the master himself.

100477	Book of horror stories	About ten years ago I checked out a book from the library that was authored by two guys with the same last name. The book had been published in the UK and the cover was white with a silhouette of a cemetery on the bottom.

117068	1990s Children's/YA Book boy left in France - cave	I read a book at some point in the 1990s and would love to read it again, but can't seem to find it on google. It's a young adult book about a boy who goes on holiday to France with his parents, but they're arguing a lot and his mum is really stressed because she has to drive around the Peripherique. His parents are in two cars as they have lots of luggage and a few children (I think), and the boy accidentally gets left behind (like in Home Alone), but no-one notices as they leave in separate cars. He has to fend for himself and shelters in a cave. I remember that at one point he has some wet matches, and he gets food by building a dam to catch fish and stealing eggs from a farm. I think it was by a British author but it may not have been - any ideas would be most appreciated (maybe my googling skills aren't good enough!)	books	Mette	1	0	NA	0	NA	0	NA	NA	1	NA	1	NA	0	0	0	NA	0	1	1	0	0	1	0	0	0	0	0	1	NA	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	1	0	0	1	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	NA	NA	NA	NA	NA
40685	Reference works regarding crime fiction	I have a pretty methodical approach to the crime genre and have found that the best way to increase my odds that I will find a writer that matches my sensibilities is through reference guides.

So far I've found two very good books that I highly recommend: Killer Books: A Reader's Guide to Exploring the Popular World of Mystery and Suspense and The Mammoth Encyclopedia of Modern Crime Fiction I'd like to know of any similar reference works.

124743	Favorite Dylan Biography?	As a start to a series of threads about favorite Dylan related books, I figured I would start with biographies. I have read No Direction Home by Robert Shelton, Behind the Shades by Clinton Heylin, Dylan: a Biography by Bob Spitz, Performing Artist: The Early Years and Performing Artist: The Middle Years by Paul Williams. Of these, the only one I dislike and would recommend avoiding is the Spitz biography, with it's tabloid-style, warts-and-all portrayal. The others all have strengths and weaknesses, but are worthwhile and enjoyable reads. I don't think of any of them as a definitive, stand-alone work, but together they give a good overall view of Dylan's life through the early 1990's, from various perspectives.  The Shelton book is stronger on Dylan's early career, with lots of interesting behind the scenes anecdotes from the rock critic who was a early Dylan fan and supporter. Great coverage of Dylan's early coffee-house days, performing at Gerdes Folk City and The Gaslight, through the now-legendary 1966 Tour with The Hawks. This is the biography I find myself referring back to when I have a question about Dylan's 1960's era career. This book is weaker in it's coverage of the 70's and 80's. The performing artist books are valuable for fans of live Dylan music whether through attending concerts or collecting bootlegs. They are written from the (slightly over-worshipful, IMO) perspective of an unmitigated Dylan fan. I read these when I was in the process of collecting Dylan bootlegs, and enjoyed comparing Williams' reaction to Dylan's performance at different concerts to my own. Since the release of the Performing Artist books, much of the music discussed has been released on the various volumes of The Bootleg Series, and is therefore much more accessible even to those who don't collect bootlegs. The Heylin book is a good overall biography of Dylan through the beginning of the never-ending tour in the late 80's, with balanced coverage of all three decades of his career to that point. I have not read the recent updated edition of this biography, which probably fills in much of Dylan's career in the past two decades. So what Dylan biographies have others read? Can anyone recommend more recent biographies that do a good job of covering his entire career so far?	books	Maria	1	0	NA	0	NA	0	NA	NA	0	NA	0	NA	0	1	1	NA	0	1	0	0	0	1	1	0	0	0	1	0	NA	0	1	0	1	0	1	0	1	0	0	0	0	0	1	0	1	0	0	1	0	0	0	0	0	NA	NA	NA	NA	NA

87239	Mid-70s horror anthology, possibly through the Scholastic Book Club	There were 2 stories in this collection that I remember well, though both titles and authors are forgotten. The first involved a man thrown into a prison that was a giant underground device that rotated. The prisoners had to pull ropes for a set amount of time every day to make the prison turn. Eventually, their cell would rotate around to the outside world and they would be released. There were gaps or irregularities in the walls that would appear every so often, allowing some movement between cells. Actually, I'd be happy if anyone could just identify this story. The second story involved a guy who had some sort of strange parasite like a slug (described as seal brown?) and he could only get rid of it by convincing some other person that his story was true and the parasite would then move to the new host. What else I remember: I am reasonably sure I got this through the Scholastic Book Club, but it does not appear to have been published by Scholastic themselves. The cover may have been either a dark teal/petrol or a rusty brown. The first story may, but only may, have been The Willows by Algernon Blackwood. I could have sworn I remembered reading the second story above while sitting in the car and hearing Bob Seger's Night Moves. The only problem is that I was a freshman in high school by the time that was released and I think the SBC stopped in middle school at that time. I also thought that ""The Man Who Sold Rope to the Gnoles"" by Margaret St. Clair was in there, but I was able to track down a publishing history for that and there were no matches with what I remember.	books	Mette	1	1	NA	0	NA	1	NA	NA	1	NA	0	NA	0	0	0	NA	0	1	0	0	1	1	1	0	0	0	0	1	NA	0	1	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	1	0	0	1	0	0	1	0	0	0	1	NA	NA	NA	NA	NA

34112	Help, can't remember - Regency, hero named Devlin, bluestocking	I think this one must be pretty old. It seems like it was a skinny little thing (possibly a Signet or Harlequin Historical).  Plot-wise The hero is a nobleman named Devlin and a confirmed bachelor. The heroine is (I think) the sister of one of his good friends, and I believe she was something of a bluestocking. One of the scenes I remember best is when he was napping on the couch in the library, and she was looking for a big book and accidentally drops Shakespeare on him - and then falls on him herself. I also seem to remember something about crab cakes. There was a young inventor who was also in love with her and made a point to come to her salons. This one was really funny, and I loved it when I was younger, but I can't seem to find it at home anymore.

67205	Survival Fiction	I like reading fiction books about survival. For example: Robinson Crusoe, Swiss Family Robinson, My Side of the Mountain, Island of the Blue Dolphins, etc... Been tag-surfing and have found a few books but not many (maybe I'm looking at the wrong sort of tags?). Ive found quite a few YA titles, nothing wrong with that but I'm interested in Adult fiction as well.

69344	Cat found in a mailbox and adopted by postal worker	I have a patron looking for a book that I cannot find, and it's driving us both crazy. I hope someone here can help.  She seems to think that it was released within the past two or three years, but is unsure whether it is fiction or nonfiction. She thought that the title might be something along the lines of The Cat in the Box, but so far I haven't found any books by that title.  As far as plot, she says that it's about a cat that was found inside a mailbox by a female postal worker. The lady went on to adopt the cat (we think).  I keep coming back to Dewey on this one, but my patron is adamant that there was no library involved. Does anyone out there have any ideas?

72482	YA/Chapter Book, involves limb-stealing society of mole rat-like creatures	Fiction. A couple kids and their mother spend a summer at a cabin in the woods. The forest is being cut down, the foresters are being taken away in the night and returned sans a body part or two, surgically removed. The kids stumble upon a society of intelligent subterranean creatures with a similar social structure to mole rats (i.e. one large, reproducing queen ruling over a colony of workers and warriors) who are stealing limbs and such from people to replace their own malfunctioning ones. I can't recall if the mole rat similarity is actually mentioned in the book. I read it at least 10 years ago, not exactly sure, and I'm pretty sure it was for teens, possibly a bit younger. Can't remember anything about the author or title, and while I can't quite remember I'm pretty sure it was a chapter book, softcover, with a kind of creepy cover illustration. This story has been bugging me for awhile because it was just so weird, and I'd like to read it again, so if anyone has heard of this before that would be amazing.	books	Maria	1	0	NA	0	NA	1	NA	NA	1	NA	0	NA	0	0	0	NA	0	1	1	0	0	0	0	0	0	1	0	1	NA	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	1	0	0	1	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	NA	NA	NA	NA	NA
117252	Fluff Reading Recommendations	I just wrapped up my BA in English and am a tad fried mentally, meaning my usual leisure reading of Victorian Sensation fiction a la Wilkie Collins isn't going to cut it. I need something legitimately light and frothy, perhaps even...*gasp*...genre. However, my caveat is that it has to be at least moderately well-written, so consulting the good folks at Literary Snobs seemed wise. For a reference point, most of my ""fluff"" books of the recent past have been female-friendly fantasy (Charles De Lint is a favorite, as is Tamora Pierce's YA work) and pseudo-Gothic fiction of the Diane Setterfield/Kate Morton sort. I've also been known to enjoy historical fiction, but it's quite hit-or-miss -- Diana Gabaldon got pitched across the room halfway through Outlander. I enjoy romance, but not when ""romance"" is synonymous with ""lots of vividly detailed sex"". I've also found Jasper Fforde to be good fun, if a little too busy spouting literary inside jokes as if to prove his street cred. Any suggestions for a decently written beach book? My frazzled nerves will thank you. I'm studying for the GRE's and anything more to remind me of course syllabi might prove to be too much.	books	Toine	0	0	NA	0	NA	0	NA	NA	0	NA	0	NA	0	0	0	NA	0	1	0	0	0	1	0	1	0	0	0	0	NA	0	0	0	1	1	0	1	0	0	0	0	1	1	1	0	1	0	0	1	0	0	0	0	0	NA	NA	NA	NA	NA

33375	Young Adult American Civil War Fiction Series...	I'm looking for a series of books I read in about 6th grade. They were about the Civil War, and told the story of two young boys (Ben and Sam?), one white and one black, who were friends with one another despite the racial differences and the time period. I believe it was a five book series. I read the books approximately 7 - 8 years back, but I can't recall their names or author. I seem to remember one of the covers featuring the black boy in a confederate uniform. The series starts with the boys' youth, and their lives develop as the series continues. The final book has them pit against each other, fighting for their sides in the US Civil War, but I think they leave their armies because they remember their friendship. Perhaps something to do with ""red haired"" or ""captive"" or ""slave"" in the titles, and I believe ""series"" was included in the general title of each. Thanks so much for your help. =)	books	Marijn	1	1	NA	0	NA	1	NA	NA	1	NA	1	NA	0	1	1	NA	0	1	1	0	1	0	0	0	0	0	0	1	NA	0	1	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	1	0	0	1	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	NA	NA	NA	NA	NA

115685	Older book Alien ship crash fiction...	I'm looking for this book, and can't remember the name it is a sci-fi book. I'm thinking it came out in the 80's or possibly 70's. The illustration on the cover pictured a desert landscape with a sun -dried and cracked desert floor. A large crack in the middle and a clawed hand reaching out from it. I think the title was only one word and it was located at the top written in a possible gold or silver lettering. The story line took place in western US, possibly Utah. There an alien craft that had crash landed and landed near a small town and the townspeople kept finding pieces of the alien craft. The rest of the details are vague since it has been over 15 to 20 years since I've read this book. But distinctly remember the picture on the cover. Any help finding out the title is extremely appreciated....	books	Maria	1	0	NA	0	NA	1	NA	NA	1	NA	1	NA	0	0	0	NA	0	1	0	0	0	0	1	0	0	0	0	1	NA	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	1	0	0	1	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	NA	NA	NA	NA	NA
25621	Mark Twain	OK, I'll admit it, I've tried to stick with Mark Twain. I read Huck Finn and Tom Sawyer in highschool, as we are all required to do. I don't know if it was taught poorly or what, but it made me dispise Twain. Don't get me wrong, I'll defend to the end teachers wanting to teach it in classes even though he uses the n-word (this was recently a big hubub here in DFW). But both stories just seemed boring to me. It seemed that teachers picked to books because boys don't like to read and these are both boy stories. They meant absolutly nothing to me. Except-I think the man is hillarious. His spot-on quotes are wonderful. I quote him all the time, so I really want to like him. But, I really don't want to go back to the boys stories. So please, someone explain or recommend some GOOD Twain to me. Edited after coffee to correct some awful sentences and to clarify some points.	books	Mette	0	0	NA	0	NA	0	NA	NA	0	NA	0	NA	0	0	0	NA	0	1	0	0	0	1	0	0	0	0	0	0	NA	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	1	0	1	0	0	0	1	0	1	0	1	NA	NA	NA	NA	NA

49454	Modern Books	As I further my education in MSU's teaching program and discuss books with my peers and colleagues, I am realizing just how little I have actually read. In high school, I read the basics: Romeo and Juliet, To Kill a Mockingbird, Macbeth, Frankenstein, etc. Are there books that you know of that take into account similar themes and also happen to be ""modern"" or contemporary? Are there new books in young adult literature that may incorporate such themes but are written by diverse authors or genders? Are there modern books that take different approaches to ideas of family, right and wrong, trials, love, etc.? I would love to learn of even more books to read and then possibly teach in a high school English classroom. I want my students to feel comfortable with what they are reading, not that they are just ""getting through"" a book. You could think about what your favorite book is and why. Or what was your favorite book in high/middle school? What did that book contain opposed to your least favorite? I appreciate any and every suggestion.

20958	Mao and Maoist China	So, I've taken a stab at starting Mao:the unknown story. I only got about an hour into it - but wow! Is it ever biased and unobjective! The first sentence is something about how ruthless he was and how many people he killed, before even mentioning that he was born (which was the 2nd sentence)! Knowing next to nothing about the time or the person, and not being informed enough to form my own opinions one way or the other, I'm looking for some bit of general background or history on which to ground myself. I'm afraid this is not it. Even with my lack of understanding or reference, this just appears to be completely partial and revisionist history making. It's definitely peaked my curiosity, but that will just mean I'll need to read something else as well. Any thoughts on this book? Any suggestions for more objective background reading on Mao and China during that time?

89854	Romantic Fiction from 1980's - woman reconnects with a man from her past and his son	This book was either a Cherish Romance or a Second Chance at Love book. The Female lead's name was Kit - short for Kitredge. She had an African Basenji dog named Hero - short for Hieroglyphic. Her brother was a pro football player and her twin (I think - can't remember his name). He helped her move to a town where she was opening a bookstore. A man from her past, Michael O'Mara (which is not the name she originally knew him as), came in and they reconnected. Michael had become an author after his years in a government organization and had a son from a woman whom he divorced and who tried to kidnap the boy. Kitt had been married to a football player who was extremely abusive and suffered from what we would now call PTSD from what happedned. She divorced him and had restraining orders on him. He violated the orders and tried to kill her. He died in a fall from the balcony he was trying to push her off of. Her brother was very protective of Kit after what happened with her ex. I remember reading this book in the mid-1980's and would very much like to find it again.	books	Toine	1	1	NA	0	NA	0	NA	NA	1	NA	0	NA	0	0	0	NA	0	1	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	1	NA	0	1	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	1	0	0	1	1	0	0	0	0	0	0	NA	NA	NA	NA	NA

Both are non-fiction and it would mean a lot to me to find these again. I hope someone recognises their descriptions. Both books were encountered in the first half of the 1990s. BOOK WITH PAINTING Probably a non-fiction book of paintings. The thing is I cannot recall who the painter was or what painting style it was (though it is fairly detailed). I've done multiple searches (lost count) for the painting with no luck. If only I could find the book it was in! No library browses have helped either. I thought it was called Promenade or Promenade in the Park or something like that, with tall trees, patches of blue sky, tall black iron fence on both sides, a path winding down the middle, and a few people. It was taller than it was wide. The painting was fairly dark, not light and pastel-like. BOOK WITH PHOTOGRAPH Again non-fiction, possibly a book of wild animals. The photograph was of a group of wolves standing on a snowy or misty hill (probably timber wolves) looking towards the photographer.	books	Toine	1	0	NA	0	NA	1	NA	NA	0	NA	0	NA	0	0	1	NA	0	1	0	0	0	0	1	0	0	1	0	1	NA	0	1	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	1	0	0	1	0	0	1	0	0	1	1	NA	NA	NA	NA	NA
5990	Arthurian and other legends with modern day characters	I have read a few of these that I can think of Arthur War Lord by Davydd ab Hugh The Dark is Rising by Susan Cooper et. al. Song of Albion by Stephen Lawhead et. al. I am sure there are others, does anyone know of any? To be more clear - books with people from the present day, from the book's point of view, that become involved with legendary heroes, not just books where a modern character goes to a fantasy world like Steven Donaldson's Lord Foul's Bane et. al. or Joel Rosenberg's Guardians of the Flame, Chronicles of Narnia et. al. Or, even those written in a modern or send-up style I suppose, like the Hercules the Legendary Journeys books from the tv series.

32063	How books... the nuts and bolts of war	I'm just throwing this topic out there to solicit some suggestions. I have a preference for what I call ""How"" books. Most military history books are ""who"" and ""when"", sometimes ""why"". I like the ""how"" books, how the war was fought, how the men were equipped, how did the troops communicate, how did the food get from the stove to the front lines, etc. Obviously I'm stretching it a bit to get the ""hows"" in there, but I think it clarifies my point. For instance, Spearheading D-Day: American Special Units of the Normandy Invasion by Jonathan Gawne Link is http://www.librarything.com/work/546741/details/20931001 since I can't ever seem to get my touchstones to work.  Another example is Weapons and Equipment of the Victorian Soldier by Donald Featherstone.  And another is Firepower: A History of the American Heavy Tank. Damn shame there seems to be a real dearth of these kinds of books nowadays.  I have oodles of these in my library, many of which I haven't entered in LibraryThing yet (who has the time?). But I'm always on the lookout for new ones. Would anyone like to post their favorites?	books	Vivien	1	0	NA	0	NA	0	NA	NA	0	NA	0	NA	0	0	1	NA	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	NA	0	0	0	1	0	0	0	0	0	1	0	0	0	1	0	1	0	0	1	0	0	0	0	0	NA	NA	NA	NA	NA

41638	Suggestions for a book discussion group	I'm looking for suggestions for our library children's literature discussion group for this fall. We did Life as We Knew It by Susan Beth Pfeffer last season and I think it was a bit too intense for some of my readers - although my partner librarian and I loved it! We need something interesting enough that we can talk for an hour about it, but not so deep that it scares everyone off. Maybe someithing like Avi's new book Seer of Shadows?

99558	Suggestions for a picky SF reader.	Hi all. I frequent this board, as well as others, a couple times a month. Alaways looking for new material and ideas for what to read next. Now i'm just getting lazy, and don't feel like sifting through post after post looking for the next thing that appeals to me. So, I'm gonna put forth a request for some good books.  First thing first; I'm picky. my fav. authors in SF are:  Peter Hamilton(love huge epics, try not too pick up a SF book unless 350+pages)  Jack McDivett (his books are shorter than PH but enjoyable to me)  Orson Card  The Herberts and the Dune books(Frank's books started out good and then went to crap, his son's books I like)  Larry Niven (Ringworld started out good and slowly died)  China Melville (Not a huge Steampunk fan but I like China)  Alastair Reynolds   Nick Sagan ( Loved his Idlewild series, and his dad is good too)  Tad Williams Otherland Series (Not too SF, but cyberpunkish?) Authors that don't agree with my taste are: Iain Banks Philip K. Dick Ursula K. Le Guin Robert A. Heinlein Neal Asher ( I am giving him a second try at the moment) I know I'm dismissing some major players in the SF realm as crap reading, as far as I'm concerned, but hey what can I say, I like what I like.  What I'm looking for is good epic SF Space Opera. Something along the lines of Peter Hamilton.	books	Vivien	0	0	NA	0	NA	0	NA	NA	0	NA	0	NA	0	0	0	NA	0	1	0	0	0	0	1	0	0	0	0	0	NA	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	1	0	0	0	0	1	0	0	0	0	0	NA	NA	NA	NA	NA

I am very much in favor of BL, but I really don't care for uber-feminine ukes (think along the lines of FAKE, which I have also read and enjoyed.)

22240	The impact of media in today's world: recommendations requested	Can anybody suggest recent (or landmark) books that can give me an overview of mainstream media its effect on how we all think? I have no formal training in mass communication, and certainly don't want to go back to college, but I am interested in these issues.  I'd appreciate it if the recommendations were written specifically for the general reader, and were relatively well-received during their release. The controversial stuff can come later.

35257	The Prince & his Fate	I don't know if I've posted re this one already but I thought it was worth another try even if I have - it's been driving me crazy for years. This story was part of a collection I read when I was young (?70's prob). It's one of the usual fairy stories except I haven't been able to find it in any collections since. This is the only story I remember so if anyone can remember ANY collections with it in I'd be very grateful. Usual thing, young prince is born, fairies come around & prophecy that he will meet his death. It will be either at the hands of a dog, an alligator/crocodile or a snake. Parents put him in a tower to keep him safe, he see's a dog & they let him have it has a pet (fools!!), I think time then passes, he goes on a trip to meet his bride - who manages to save him from at least 2 of his 'fates' - puts out a dish of milk with sleeping potion & kills the snake & drags him out of the river when the dog knocks him in - can't remember what she did with the crocodile.  The last line was something along the lines of 'My wife is stronger than my fate'. I can picture the illustrations in it & everything. Hopefully someone remembers this, if not I'll have to start believing I made it up.	books	Maria	1	1	NA	0	NA	0	NA	NA	1	NA	0	NA	0	0	0	NA	0	1	0	0	1	0	0	0	0	0	0	1	NA	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	1	0	0	1	0	0	1	0	0	1	0	NA	NA	NA	NA	NA
116026	A request for recommendations on: Economics/logistics/supply.	Dear Group, I guess I have a reasonable overview of WWII. BUT. I just bought a DVD ($5 bin, how could I not) on the Tiger Tank. In it they mentioned it was costed at One Million RM and took 3.5 Million man hours to build! I realized I have NO real understaning of that aspect at all. Thus how much effort to say build a T34 or Sherman. Or A UBoat or Spitfire? Or even the simple Uniform a soldier wore. What percentage of the war effort (All sides) was spent on WHAT and WHY? Any recommendations on this topic or even other related topics such as ""supply/repair/etc"" in the field? I guess I am starting to think about the Logistics of War. I think I have sofar bought 7 books you people have recommended. Thanks. Oh, just realised. My request. Any books you can recommend?

129416	Suggestions for ""Enmity of Kin""	Sometimes finding books that fall into each situation can be a little hard. Let's help each other out! This thread is for Enmity of Kin. In this plot there must be a malevolent kinsman and a hated or reciprocally hating kinsman. The difference between this and Rivalry of Kin is that there must be more hatred than love present in the relationship. When you hate your friend, you just stop being friends. So this plot almost requires for the parties involved to be family. Subcategories include: 1. One brother hated by several. 2. Reciprocal hatred. 3. Hatred between relatives for reasons of self-interest. 4. Hatred of father and son. 5. Hatred of son for the father. 6. Hatred of daughter for the father. 7. Hatred of grandfather for grandson. 8. Hatred of father-in-law for son-in-law. 9. Hatred of mother-in-law for daughter-in-law. 10. Infanticide. This one is a tough one. I only have two suggestions, and both of them are a stretch. Memoirs of a Geisha, while the characters might not be blood related, they do live as a ""family"" in the same house for many years and the rivalry is for self preservation. Harry Potter and the Order of the Phoenix may count because Harry hates his godfather for most of the story. Any others?	books	Mette	1	1	NA	0	NA	0	NA	NA	0	NA	0	NA	0	0	1	NA	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	NA	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	1	0	1	0	0	1	0	0	0	0	0	NA	NA	NA	NA	NA

124754	Ideas for 9 year old girl?	I want to get my 9-year-old cousin 3 books for Christmas, since I'm getting her 14-year-old sister a trilogy and sibling rivalry means they need similar types and amounts of presents. (Besides, I love reading, and would really like to get both of them to love reading too.) But, while I have more ideas than I need for her older sister, I have no idea what to get the 9-year-old. She is currently in 4th grade, and reads at grade level.  She often starts books, loses interest, and doesn't finish them. I already tried giving her Matilda and some of the other Roald Dahl books (the BFG, and the 2 Willy Wonka books, since she liked the Charlie and the Chocolate Factory film), but she wasn't interested in them. (Maybe they were too low of a reading level? While Amazon says a lot of the Roald Dahl books are for ages 9-12, I read them when I was 4, and I've seen threads about parents introducing their kids to them at ages 5-6. I mean, I still love them - great children's lit is great at any age - but I don't know if appropriate reading level is an issue with her not finishing/being interested in things, or if she just didn't like them. I've tried asking why she doesn't like certain books and what she thinks might interest her, but she doesn't do a lot of reading for pleasure and I don't get a lot of helpful responses.) She does like the Harry Potter books she's read.  I'd like to get her the first book in the Animorphs series, since I know I liked those books when I was younger and they're individually not very long, but I don't know what to buy for the other two. Since I don't know if she'll lose interest in Animorphs before the end of the 1st book, I don't think I should buy books 1-3 in that series. Would the first book in the Percy Jackson series be a good idea? I remember reading The Giver in school in 4th grade and loving it, but Amazon calls it a YA book.  Can someone help me out with some suggestions? Something about the level of the first 2 books of the Harry Potter series is probably about right for her reading level, and she finished both of those. Suggestions with strong female characters would especially be appreciated - I'm trying to segue her older sister from obsessively re-reading Twilight into enjoying other supernatural/dystopian/paranormal YA series with female protagonists stronger than Bella Swan. (Note: I also crossposted this to the other children's group, since I wasn't sure which group would be a more appropriate area for asking. If one needs to be taken down, someone please let me know; I don't frequent these forums often.)	books	Mette	1	1	NA	0	NA	0	NA	NA	0	NA	0	NA	0	0	0	NA	0	1	1	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	NA	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	1	1	1	0	1	0	0	1	0	0	0	0	0	NA	NA	NA	NA	NA

This is a book I read ages ago....wondering what it is titled and who wrote it. The opening scene was the ""hero"" showing up at this small house..along with the police. He was there to evict the ""heroine"" and her teenage sister, teenage brother and younger siblings. Some of the small town residents (men) were there as well. Someone was emptying all of their possession out of the house and on the front yard. He was angry and evicting her because her mother had an affair with his father. The teen girl, was a promiscuous girl like the mother, but the heroine was a stand up girl trying to keep her siblings fed and housed. Would love to know the name/author.

As for the content, as I said in the subject line - it covers most of history, with segues into music of the time or tie-in movies- I particularly remember Ella Fitzgerald being recommended.

I used to think the title was ""The Midnight Hour"" but I've searched everywhere for it and have had no luck (it is not by Karen Robards).  The characters were animals (definately had a lion and a pig in it). The only thing I remember about the plot was that they were invited to a big mansion. Throughout the book there a pictures that offer clues to solving the mystery. I can remember two pictures, one being a huge wrought-iron gate leading to the mansion (I think it was on the gate where ""midnight hour"" was written). The other picture I remember is the animals sitting around a table playing poker.

I've found an article or two, but would like to present him with a range of stuff for him to choose from. Also, if anyone could find/write a short explanation of the numbering system for me to give to him, I'd appreciate it. A couple of the articles I've found have quotes from the suttas at the beginning, and it'd be nice if he could explain the references if a student asks.	books	Marijn	1	0	NA	0	NA	0	NA	NA	0	NA	0	NA	0	0	1	NA	0	1	1	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	NA	0	0	0	1	0	0	0	0	0	1	0	1	1	1	0	1	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	NA	NA	NA	NA	NA

76625	Hello, new member with a question	OK, two questions and a greeting. Hi, nice to meet you all. :) One question is about structure, the site just has a list of posts in my display, no set order, is that a fault of my set-up, or what you all see too?. Do posts come to the top page because they are used, sort of thing?. Basically, is there somewhere I can see how best to proceed?. Second question is, I read a fantasy novel recently, and could any of you guys identify it for me as it was quite good, and had sequels I would like to read. Female writer. Female protagonist. She discovers she is the lost heir to an alternate world, people of special bloodlines can move between the two worlds, ours and a more medieval one. People there live in castles, have a great fear of dimension hopping assassins. The ruling classes of the other world make a living by selling people there some of our technology, but pay for it all by running cocaine between the worlds. Each time one of the special people crosses between the worlds they are required to do a little mule work.	books	Maria	1	1	NA	0	NA	0	NA	NA	1	NA	0	NA	0	0	0	NA	0	1	0	0	0	1	0	0	0	0	0	0	NA	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	1	0	0	1	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	NA	NA	NA	NA	NA

62960	Gonna have to find a new book for Portugal	Yesterday, for my around the world challenge, I tried to read The History of the Siege of Lisbon by Jos Saramago. Unfortunately I'm afraid I'll have to find another book for Portugal; I COULD NOT STAND Senor Saramago's writing style. Paragraphs that went on for pages; sentences that ran on forever. I counted one sentence with 80 words; another sentence ran for eighteen lines. That, combined with the fact that in the first thirty pages of the book ABSOLUTELY NOTHING HAPPENED, lead me to quite literally throw the book across the room in frustration. Has anyone else read any more of Saramago's books? If so, are they all written like that? Anybody have any suggestions for another book set in Portugal?	books	Marijn	1	0	NA	0	NA	0	NA	NA	0	NA	1	NA	1	0	0	NA	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	NA	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	1	0	1	0	0	1	0	0	0	0	0	NA	NA	NA	NA	NA

126140	Mystery set in American Southwest / Female lead	Trying to remember the title of a book I read years ago - here's what I can recall: It was a fiction/mystery set in the southwest; the lead character was a woman, recently divorced and with a daughter of maybe about four; at some point in the beginning she and the daughter had applesauce for dessert at home; I don't think she was an actual detective or officer of any kind, just a woman caught in a mystery; she was kind of a loner and didn't have a sidekick; at some point she was being chased through the southwest landscape, trying to dodge someone. It wasn't really fast-paced and it wasn't humorous, but somewhat eerie, slow, quiet, and sort of noir. I want to say the book could be about 20 years old - I read it in the early-mid 2000's but it wasn't a new book at the time. I've tried doing tag searches and gone through tons of books but so far nothing quite fits. Thanks for any help - this is driving me crazy.	books	Marijn	1	1	NA	0	NA	0	NA	NA	1	NA	1	NA	1	0	0	NA	0	1	0	0	0	0	1	0	0	0	0	1	NA	0	0	0	1	0	0	1	0	0	0	0	0	0	1	0	0	1	0	0	1	0	0	1	0	NA	NA	NA	NA	NA
62165	Native American mythical woman	This book title has escaped me. The plot involves a Native American woman that has been alive for centuries.

42109	Children's picture book photographs feelings / family 1970s?	A book I grew up with that I'd really like to find ... Any suggestions appreciated! * Had the book from early-mid 1980s at least, although I do not recall when my family obtained it.  * May talk about feelings in the story, and family, and could be part of a series as mentioned on the back cover. Series might be called something like ""How I feel"" or similar. I've tried searching many times to no avail. * The book had photographs throughout, all most likely in colour. Generally it was photo on one side, text on the other (reasonable amount of text, not just a tiny bit). * The book had a 1970s feel (clothing etc.), may have been published then.  * The girl (main character) had long straight brown hair, very pretty, wore a red jumper, a (brown?) skirt as well. She carried a suitcase at one point. Her facial expression in one photo showed she was not happy with her parents -- the photo showed the girl standing with her back to camera, her parents in front of her facing the camera who have angry faces.  * Another photo: the girl at the door of a house holding a suitcase, or maybe it's on the ground, and she is looking back at the camera.  * The back cover could be red or orange or reddish-orange. The photo on the front cover, possibly an insert.	books	Mette	1	1	NA	0	NA	1	NA	NA	0	NA	0	NA	0	0	1	NA	0	1	1	0	1	0	0	0	0	0	0	1	NA	0	1	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	1	0	0	1	0	0	1	0	0	0	1	NA	NA	NA	NA	NA

38351	Help! Urania stranded in 19th-Century Russia. Needs compass.	Bonjour Global Readers, In a few months, my real-time Prousters will cease to be Prousters and become Dostoevskians. I have put together our reading list - some, but not all of which, I have read. I direct the group and thus feel responsible for reading or rereading ahead of time all the novels we will be reading. I wish to immerse myself in all things Russian (or at least some things Russian). For example, I would like to read some scholarly history/criticism about the social, political, and religious culture of the time. Of course, no dearth of material exists out there, but not being a Russian literature specialist, I dont really know which works are considered seminal (or ovular) and which are not. Most university professors are no longer making their syllabi freely available; rather one has to access them through each universitys BlackBoard site. Consequently, that shortcut is out of bounds for me. If any of you are nineteenth-century Russian specialists (of any specialty whatsoever), I would appreciate titles. After having spent four days with Dostoevsky, I have some initial impressions, some of which are probably stereotypes. Ill list them as follows. If anyone out there is Russian, please dont be offended. Im really speaking out of ignorance here, as well as a desire to become better informed. 1. D. along with all most of the other Russian writers I have read strikes me as incredibly passionate and given to fits of mysticism. When I read Russian literature, I cant imagine American or English writers describing intense emotions of love and friendship the way the Russian writers do. The closest examples I can think of exist in some of the late 18th-century gothic novels. Ive read snippets of Russian literature (in translation) and listened to Russian religious music from the Middle Ages to the present. These particular elements strike me as characteristic of all that Ive read and heard. 2. Russian writers all seem slightly insane (and I dont mean this in a negative sense); rather, the intensity of their emotions seem off-balance from an American point of view (which is certainly not the be-all and end-all of viewpoints by any means). 3. Even the writing of secular Russian authors strikes me as deeply religious in spirit and tone (or at least religious in terms of my meager understanding of the Russian Orthodox Church). 4. Are there any happy Russian writers out there? I know there must be. Most of the Russians that I have met, apart from my former sister-in-law, strike me as happy. 5. Finally, in all the Russian literature Ive read, I get the sense that the authors and their characters take pride in and draw strength from their suffering. Again, I know Im stereotyping here. I would appreciate correction where correction is due (and also scholarly reading suggestions). Thanks. P.S. Please be gentle with your criticism of this post. I have a full body case of poison ivy and am feeling a bit miserable and sorry for myself. In other words, I'm not drawing any strength from my suffering ;)	books	Vivien	1	0	NA	0	NA	0	NA	NA	0	NA	1	NA	0	1	1	NA	0	1	0	0	0	0	1	0	0	0	0	0	NA	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	1	0	1	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	NA	NA	NA	NA	NA

131548	English Boy Thinks He Finds Eden	My girlfriend and I are trying to figure out the name of a book she read in high school several years ago. It was a novel about an English schoolboy having some sort of mental breakdown in the late 19th or early 20th Century. He starts to believe that his friend's mother is Eve, and her yard is literally the garden of Eden. It was very much a coming of age story about trying to find one's self in a world that tries to define you. Though she read it in high school, she does not think it was published for young adults. She does not remember when it was published, but is sure it was not new when she read it.  What she does recall very clearly that the title was the name of the main character, and probably started with an 'h'. The cover was an image of the boy in his school uniform.

70026	american fiction about family transporting mother's dead body in a wagon in the south	Alright people, I need to find this book. Maybe my descriptive skills combined with all the brilliant people of the Internet can make this happen. Chapters are broken up into the perspectives/voices of different family members. One son is a carpenter who builds his mother's casket while she is on her death bed. There is a younger boy who thinks his mother is talking to him on the journey because he hears the noises of the corpse decaying inside the casket. There is some old guy who thinks that people aren't supposed to move around because they are built like trees. They are moving the body across the country so she can be laid to rest in some other town. At some point they try to cross a river with their wagon but, alas, just as it is fated while playing 'Oregon Trail' in grade school, the wagon tips over. They dive in the river to find the carpentry tools. I think there's a girl too. She maybe is pregnant and gets/almost gets a sketchy abortion in the town where they end up because she was fooling around with the farm hand. And perhaps there something about borrowing shovels at the end there too that's a quasi-big deal. That or everything the paragraph connected to this sentence is from a different book. I read this book a couple of years ago at the recommendation of a friend who has thus far not responded to my begging for information. I have no idea when it was written, except I assume the author has some interest in post-modern systems of identity as each character is an independent voice (complete with different vocabulary and dialects as necessary). Wait, is post-modern correct there? I know nothing about literature.

This will be the first reading challenge that I have given myself to do, and I have decided to use the author's last name to complete it. I am writing this post to request help with finding authors to fill out my list, as I do not tend to read a varity of different authors. After mostly browsing and rarely posting on the LT forums, I have noticed that this group fits closest to my reading tastes. With my favorite authors being Tolkien followed by Crichton.

(but I am easily scared) It's not: an American series of books from the 2000s It's not: a Terry Pratchett set around there It's not: the Rosemary Sutcliffe about the carving of the white horse. Well, I don't think it is. It might be, if there are modern kids in that one.

Also any fingerplays or feltboard stories you have  done.  I find it hard to find free color pages that go along with a book.

22722	OT: A different sort of request...	You are such intelligent and compassionate folk, I'm hoping you'll be able to help me. If you don't like angsty or emo issues, skip this. :) Short version - I come from a very dysfunctional family. I have been dealing with depression and anxiety for decades. My addiction of choice is food which has caused me to be horrendously over weight (600+ pounds.) I'm currently in an eating disorder program which is helping.  I'm having a real problem with self-worth and existential anxiety. Basically, one is in the dirt (worth) and the other is through the roof (anxiety.) I feel as if I have to be a human ""doing"" rather than a human ""being"" to have any value and it's very difficult for me to figure out exactly what I want to do with myself. Do I want to do something because I like it or because I think it is something I SHOULD do? I'm NOT looking for sympathy or ""I value you!"" comments. To be honest, they aren't helpful. What I AM looking for are personal stories/comments about yourself or book recommendations (fiction or non) that deal with these subjects - especially self-worth. Spiritual readings are also helpful. Anyone?	books	Marijn	1	0	NA	0	NA	0	NA	NA	0	NA	0	NA	0	0	1	NA	0	1	0	0	0	0	1	0	0	0	0	0	NA	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	1	0	1	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	NA	NA	NA	NA	NA
34111	Regency romance, hero named Devlin, bluestocking	I think this one must be pretty old. It seems like it was a skinny little thing (possibly a Signet or Harlequin Historical).  Plot-wise The hero is a nobleman named Devlin and a confirmed bachelor. The heroine is (I think) the sister of one of his good friends, and I believe she was something of a bluestocking. One of the scenes I remember best is when he was napping on the couch in the library, and she was looking for a big book and accidentally drops Shakespeare on him - and then falls on him herself. I also seem to remember something about crab cakes. There was a young inventor who was also in love with her and made a point to come to her salons. This one was really funny, and I loved it when I was younger, but I can't seem to find it at home anymore. Anybody have any ideas?	books	Maria	1	1	NA	0	NA	0	NA	NA	1	NA	0	NA	0	0	0	NA	0	1	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	1	NA	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	1	0	0	1	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	NA	NA	NA	NA	NA

50328	Puzzle/mystery books, large format, late 80s	This is from a query on the ""Whatsthatbook.com"" site - I like the sound of the books and would not only love to answer the person's question, I'd like to find these books myself. Can anybody help? ""These books were nicely illustrated and had quite a dark theme. They told stories in which the reader was cast as protagonist (though there was no 'fighting fantasy' choice element as in ""turn to page 10 to go North, turn to page 11 to go South"""". Each page featured some sort of puzzle(s) and there were common puzzle themes running through the book. Often some sort of problem / cliffhanger would arise and there would be a question about how the character was going to proceed and overcome the problem. When you turned the page you'd find out whether you had guessed the right solution. One I recall as being about a run-down burlesque funfair, and some sort of evil plot involving poison gas hidden in light bulbs (one of the puzzles running through that book involved spotting the bulbs which contained the gas). The other book, in the same series, had a fantasy setting and the only puzzle I remember involved a question of where a character could hide having escaped from a castle into the surrounding moat, the answer being that he should use some reeds to form a snorkel to breathe through. My recollection is a fairly large format book.""	books	Marijn	1	1	NA	0	NA	1	NA	NA	1	NA	0	NA	1	0	1	NA	0	1	0	0	1	0	1	0	0	1	0	0	NA	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	1	0	0	1	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	NA	NA	NA	NA	NA
40056	looking for a wwii romance	I'm trying to find a WW II romance I read a long time ago, probably in the late 70's or early eighties. A young woman gets caught in the blitz in London -- I remember something about a tube station or a bomb shelter. She meets a young man -- a soldier?-- and takes him home -- they have a brief affair and he leaves. Somehow I think she doesn't know his full name and doesn't know how to find him, or maybe he gets wounded and forgets who he is (I may be mixing up two stories here, as I'm also remembering one where the heroine is a nurse and finds the hero amnesiac with a head wound. I don't know if it's the same or not.) Anyway, does this sound familiar to anyone? The heroine's name may be Claire or Mary.	books	Mette	1	1	NA	0	NA	0	NA	NA	1	NA	1	NA	0	1	1	NA	0	1	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	1	NA	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	1	0	0	1	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	NA	NA	NA	NA	NA
110636	typewriter haunted by pulp writer	I read this around 1974-6 and it seemed like a new book at the time. Slim hardcover, can't remember what the dustjacket looked like, but I don't think it was pictorial. A struggling writer moves into a boarding house run by a large-bosomed and rather slovenly landlady. She gives him a typewriter to use, which turns out to be possessed by the previous owner's ghost. The ghost takes over and types out pulp-style adventures in various genres (exploration, detective, sword & sorcery) each involving a mysterious and voluptuous woman, and each missing the ending.  The climax of the book is that the young writer pushes through to the ending of the story and discovers that the Amazon Queen he's questing for is the landlady, with whom the previous lodger was in love.  It may have been written in the early 60s - I read TRIO: The Revolting Intellectuals Organization at about the same time, and it also looked like a new book. Both were in the Fraser Valley Regional Library System.	books	Maria	1	0	NA	0	NA	1	NA	NA	1	NA	0	NA	0	0	0	NA	0	1	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	1	NA	0	1	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	1	0	0	1	0	1	0	0	0	0	0	NA	NA	NA	NA	NA

14641	Looking for a title	An acquaintance of mine is looking for some help finding a title and I told him I'd post it on LT and see what we could come up with...below is his query...any ideas? As I write this, I'm watching Simon Schama's ""The Power of Art"" on WGBH. He's devoted an entire show to Van Gogh's ""Wheatfield with Crows."" I was reminded of a short story from one of the ""new horror"" anthologies published about a decade ago. The story is about an art historian who is attempting to understand the breakthrough event during Van Gogh's residency in Arles. The event has an alien/sfnal explanation that results in the narrator going insane in the same manner as as Van Gogh. The title is something like ""Orange is the Color of Paranoia, Blue is the color of Pain.""  Google searches on almost any combination of the words in what I think is the title turn up hits for ""Orange Was the Color of Her Dress Then Silk Blues,"" the jazz classic by Charles Mingus. I'm stuck. Does anyone else know the title and author of the story I'm describing?	books	Toine	1	1	NA	0	NA	0	NA	NA	1	NA	1	NA	0	1	0	NA	0	1	0	0	0	1	1	0	0	0	0	1	NA	0	1	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	1	1	1	0	0	1	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	NA	NA	NA	NA	NA

Graphics/art style:Pixel art Notable characters: Main character is heavily wrapped in rags and trained in some martial art where he can make as few movements as possible to conserve energy. Notable gameplay mechanics: The big pull was the energy conservation mechanic. Every step you take drains your energy bar and it's best to defeat your enemies in as few movements as possible. Enemies are bound by this mechanic as well allowing players to tire bandits out to defeat them easier.

I'm open to the idea of strategy/tactics games as well, but I've played a ton of Battletech and Xcom lately and I'm trying to avoid getting burnt out on that sort of thing.	games	Toine	1	0	0	0	1	0	NA	NA	0	NA	0	0	0	0	0	NA	0	1	0	0	0	0	1	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	1	0	NA	0	0	0	1	0	0	0	1	0	1	0	0	1	1	0	1	0	0	1	1	0	0	1
8rfe36	Any medieval or Fantasy city building games that actually mimic a regular city builder instead of using 'medieval' as an excuse for 'shallow'?	For instance, I've never seen a medieval/fantasy builder with the following, and I'd really like to play a game that has these things: - Guard houses to send guard patrols out and arrest criminals like a medieval police station - A fire-prevention housing with a crew like a medieval fire department - A town (or kingdom) alert system via a bell or fire signals if attackers are coming - Anything to do with traffic management like separate roads for supply caravans, etc - Anything dealing with waste distribution Those kind of things that are very common in city builders like Cities:Skylines and Simcity but any medieval city builder I've seen like Life Is Feudal: Forest Village or Banished just ignores them.	games	Vivien	1	0	0	0	1	0	NA	NA	0	NA	0	0	0	0	0	NA	0	1	0	0	0	0	1	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	NA	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	1	0	1	0	0	1	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0
8o1eod	Puzzle game with round robot	I'm looking for the name of a relatively recent puzzle game (within the last 6-7 years). You control a simple round white robot, like just a ball with a photo lens representing an eye. The puzzles have you manipulating cubes of matter, like putting a sand cube in front of a laser to turn it into a glass cube. I remember you collect some golden...puzzle pieces or photo pieces (gets kinda foggy when I go into that much detail).

8q4e3f	[PC][late 2000s] Blue aircraft action game	Played the game on PC , i think it's an exclusive but i am not sure about that flying ,action,shooting **mid/late 2000s** **Not too fancy graphics , reminds me of red alert : command and conquer. used to enjoy the graphic style though , good for its era** **As the main character , we pilot a fancy blue aircraft that has machine gun type artillery on it . Communicating over radio with military base which gives us instructions. ** **Main gameplay mechanic that i can remember is how easily the aircraft can land like a transformer . it was then easier to destroy targets. i can also remember a sonar at the top (left?) of the screen showing red dots for enemies** **I remember the game having many different types of levels along the 'storyline' where you either have to protect allies , destroy enemies , boss fights etc.** PS: if you remember a relatively big blue aircraft that could land on the ground with no considerable effort then i really doubt that there are many similar games.

8q5c0u	[PC] Old, pre 2007, WW2 Dogfight Game	(On mobile, sorry about organization.) *Platform:* Windows PC, it was quite a while ago, but probably windows XP. *Genre:* WW2 Dogfighting type of game *Estimated Year of Release:* 2000-2004-ish *Graphics/Art Style:* It was a 3D Dogfighting game, almost like Ace Combat but only 3rd person from what I remember. *Notable Characters:* There were no characters, but there were planes that I remember. There was a German fighter plane that was purple with an iron cross on the side, there was a bi-plane which I remember being part of the British RAF or the American Air Force. *Notable Gameplay Mechanics:* I don't remember the main screen or anything about selecting missions, but I know you got to choose your plane. The best plane for the mission always had 'Recommended' in yellow text under the photo of the plane. I don't remember the controls but I think the fire button was just left click. It almost reminds me of War Thunder, but I do not think it was not multiplayer and there was no customization of the aircraft. I do not remember what happened if you had died and I don't think there was any type of point system. *Other Details:* If this helps, I remember one of the missions starting off with flying above the coast of some country (probably Germany or France or something, I don't remember if it was a lake, ocean, etc.) with a squadron of other bi-planes. I also remember you had to kill the Red Baron, a red bi-plane (tri-plane?) with 3 sets of wings stacked on top of one another - basically a bi-plane with one more set of wings above. There were AA guns firing and the explosions were going off around your squadron but didn't harm you. I also very vaguely remember a mission where you had to take off of an aircraft carrier.	games	Marijn	1	1	0	0	1	1	NA	NA	1	NA	1	0	0	0	0	NA	0	1	0	0	0	0	1	0	0	1	0	1	0	0	0	0	1	0	NA	0	0	0	1	0	0	0	1	0	0	1	0	1	0	0	0	0	0	1	0	1	0	1

Top down style. **Notable characters:** The main character I remember to be an animal-based humanoid. **Notable gameplay mechanics:** Possibly the main mechanic I remember was collecting apples and other fruit from trees every so often. There were other key gameplay mechanics unlocking different options and NPCs to talk to, unlocking new islands and activities. **Other details:** I used to play this game on a browser at my grandfather's old house when we used to visit.

8qimrx	[NES][before 2000] Action/beat'em up	Platform(s): NES Genre: Action/Beat'em up - single player Estimated year of release: Honestly don't know. I played it before year 2000, but I don't know when it was released. Graphics/art style: Much like DoubleDragon, 2.5D/2D, human character fighting foes (not sure if 100% humans), definitely NOT candys&amp;amp;unicorns style. Notable characters: In boss encounter one protagonist had a sword (a curved one, possibly japanese). One boss was a crane-style master. Other boss had a circular saw blade that he spinned from top of the screen to the bottom, and then back up like a boomerang (that saw you could destroy with a sword-wielding player and the boss, having no weapon, would just attempt to beat you up with it's fists). One boss you fought on a round/oval platform of ice with no edges (so you could jump off and die, you could also manouvre the boss to do the same and win instantly) - that boss 'move' was to spin on his head on the ice (think break-dance), damaging and pushing you if it hit you, possibly off the platform. Notable gameplay mechanics: You could switch character you were playing (but I don't remember other than the one with the sword), you could transfer hitpoints from 'some female character' to the one you were playing (using a special menu - and the game played a march-like sound while the hitpoints transferred). Some of the bosses you defeated you could play in other boss encounters (like the crane-style master). Other details: Game was single-player, but the second controller acted like a cheat input (don't remember what could be done, but you entered some key combinations through other controller and it affected the game).	games	Maria	1	1	0	0	1	1	NA	NA	0	NA	0	0	0	0	0	NA	0	1	0	0	0	0	1	0	0	1	0	1	0	0	0	0	0	0	NA	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	1	0	0	1	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	1	0	1	0	1
8ocafg	[PC][1995-2004] children's game about farming/gardening	\(sorry for any english mistakes\) I'm not really sure about the year that it was released, but it was around 1995\-2004. You could use your keyboard arrows to navigate through the scenarios \(they were still images, but you could click on them and interact with the objects and plants\). I remember that some of those scenarios were: \- a bedroom, with some sort of monster under the bed, but you couldn't really see it. You could turn on a tv that was there and watch the news, or listen to music on the radio. \- the front yard, where you could plant flowers and stuff. It had a big tree on the top of the screen and if you clicked on its branches, a squirrel would swing from a rope, making tarzan like sounds. \- the backyard, where you could tend the soil, plant corn and tomatoes and some weird alien vegetables or some creepy things, like, i remember there was a 'baby' plant, that literally was just baby faces on some sort of fruit plant. And you could also customize your own scarecrow This is all that I recall now, but it just had this ridiculous and creepy vibe to it, even though it was meant for young children learning words and numbers and etc	games	Marijn	1	1	0	0	1	0	NA	NA	0	NA	1	0	0	0	0	NA	0	1	1	0	0	0	1	0	0	1	0	1	0	0	0	0	1	0	NA	1	0	0	0	0	0	0	1	0	0	1	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	1	0	1	0	0

8qdjzy	highest rated card games (or games with aspects from card games?) - detailed post	1. card games are one of the game i kinda like 1. one reason is **variety** 1. **variety** means multiple options 1. **one ongoing problem** is that it's hard to create variety while keeping balance 1. with balance, the multiple options are not unique and thus meaningless 1. **if a game is able to reach variety and balance that would be quite impressive** 1. variety &amp;amp; balance are important in all kinds of games, not just card games 1. so this isnt the reason why i like card game, since this isnt a unique reason -- 1. **discovery** of new parts of teh game (cards, actions, else) is important 2. but the newness of things disappears quickly 3. devs almost never can keep up content creation at the pace where it would override discovery 4. discovery is very difficult challenge 5. and i dont think there's any games in existence, or for a very long time that would have continuous discovery 1. the best solution for this would be that society that creates new games, but since there's very few ppl in society like that, and most ppl do essentially nothing, this wont happen 1. a society where most ppl are creating and innovating and doing productive things would solve this problem, but that is an extremely difficult goal of humanity 1. so discovery is not a sustainable thing --- ok so i realised this would turn out to be like 10-100 pages of explanations and details or something, and we're only 1/4th of a page into this topic, so im going to just stop here #what is the highest rated card game currently? to make sure the suggestion is good, check the ratings before recommending 80/100 or higher seems like an ok start http://www.metacritic.com/browse/games/score/metascore/year/pc?view=condensed&amp;amp;sort=desc http://www.metacritic.com/browse/games/score/metascore/all/xboxone/filtered?sort=desc&amp;amp;view=condensed http://store.steampowered.com/app/292030/The_Witcher_3_Wild_Hunt/ #any highly rated games that have elements of card games are good also? to make sure the suggestion is good, check the ratings before recommending	games	Marijn	1	0	0	0	1	0	NA	NA	0	NA	0	0	0	0	0	NA	0	1	0	0	0	0	1	0	1	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	1	1	NA	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	1	0	1	0	0	0	1	1	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0
8rr8gk	[PC/DOS?][2005-ish] Freeware, cave flyer splitscreen, bumpers as a level hazard	The game was a cave flyer (if anyone's familiar with that term), kind of like [A2](https://www.mobygames.com/game/a2-the-ultimate-sequel-to-auts-the-ultimate-stress-relief-game) or [Wings 2](https://www.mobygames.com/game/wings-2), but neither of those looks right. I played it on Windows, most probably XP, sometime from probably-2005-to-2008, downloaded for free. There's a chance it was made earlier than that, maybe made for DOS and was running in an emulator; I have a vague memory that there was some compatibility weirdness. From what I remember of the art style, it was simple with mostly flat colors and shaded edges. (There's a good chance I'm misremembering though.) It had a splitscreen multiplayer focus, and I believe player 1 and 2 were red and yellow ships, with a simple 'Asteroids' design. Some of the levels included bumpers on the walls that would push your ship back. One level covered the walls with them. I think one level was mostly full of water, but it was just a colored background and didn't affect physics. I got the impression it was designed to be easy to add custom levels. It's not bugging me too much, but if anyone knows the specific game I'm thinking of, it'd be nice to hear! And my apologies if the way I described anything is hard to understand.	games	Maria	1	0	0	0	0	1	NA	NA	0	NA	1	0	0	0	0	NA	0	1	0	1	0	0	0	0	0	1	0	1	0	0	0	0	0	0	NA	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	1	0	0	1	0	0	1	1	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0

It was a PC game, I think it was played online on a website but I can't remember for sure, it may have been a download. From what I can remember, on the start you were born as a random human. You could be male or female, be born with a genetic defect, or whatever. If you were born female in a country like Saudi Arabia, it would give you a message saying that you can't vote or work and have few rights. If the country was low in development, you were likely to die as a baby from sickness or starve to death, and it was more difficult to make a good life. You were more likely to be born in populous countries like China, and very unlikely to be born in low population countries. After that you made different decisions on how you wanted to live your life. Your character had different stats like intelligence which determined how successful they could be, like if you could go to a university and become a doctor. You had relationship stats with your family members, and I think there was even a basic romance system where you could have a partner, get married, and have kids. I remember you could be arrested and killed for political activism. The interface mostly consisted of looking at a map of the world and reading pop ups about news and your life, and I think there was a separate interface screen to look at your stats and view things like your family members. The graphics of the game were extremely basic, mostly consisting of numbers and a map, and I think maybe some very basic ugly models for characters.	games	Toine	1	0	0	0	1	1	NA	NA	0	NA	0	0	0	0	0	NA	0	1	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	1	0	1	0	0	0	0	0	0	NA	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	1	0	0	1	0	0	1	0	0	0	1	0	0	0	0	0

8remim	[PC][Early 2000s]An isometric shooter with RPG elements	**Platform(s):** It was for PC. **Genre:** An Isometric shooter **Estimated year of release:** id estimate around 2000 to 2002 **Graphics/art style:** Isometric kind of alright looking graphics. The main biome from what i remember was frosty and general tundra looking stuff. **Notable characters:** No characters from what i remember. **Notable gameplay mechanics:** You shoot a bunch of stuff (cant remember if aliens or people). We probably played it cuz it was kind of similar to Alien Shooter. **Other details:** We are from Moldova, we rented the game around 2005 or smth, had a weak PC, but it ran well so it was easy on the hardware. It was a russian translation probably because i remember the title was something with ''Noj' which means 'knife'in russian. I also remember there were a whole bunch of barraks in the snow (like half cilinder looking barraks). The back of the box advertised some giant robot fights or smth, which got us hyped but we never found. Please help me find it. It might be the last old game i've never found.	games	Maria	1	0	0	0	1	1	NA	NA	0	NA	0	0	0	0	0	NA	0	1	0	1	0	0	1	1	0	1	0	1	0	1	1	0	0	0	NA	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	1	0	0	1	0	1	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0

8q1hxp	Looking for a game similar to Ogre Battle 64 and Soul Nomad &amp;amp; The World Eaters	Hey everyone, I've long searched for games similar to Ogre battle and Soul Nomad. I really enjoyed the 9 title 3x3 style format for unit placement with a strategy focus. I enjoyed putting together multiple squads and testing different combinations. It felt like I was managing an army but not like in starcraft where it got little chaotic. Any suggestions would be much appreciated. On a side note, if anyone knows how I could play those two games, that would be cool as well.	games	Marijn	1	0	0	0	1	1	NA	NA	0	NA	0	0	0	0	0	NA	0	1	0	0	0	0	1	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	1	0	NA	1	0	0	0	0	0	0	1	0	1	0	0	1	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0
8sl3m7	Fun, pretty games for my 'drought'	Hey all, I'm going through a period where I don't have any game that piques my interest, and has my attention to the point that I am excited and look forward to my next gaming session. At the moment I have a few games I juggle; SotC, Hollow Knight, Celeste, and Bastion. Pretty good games that I like (naturally, else I wouldn't still be playing them) but not one of them is too exciting; I'd play 15 minutes and then feel tired. I'm waiting for August, when Yakuza 0 comes out on PC, and September when Spiderman comes out. So I want something to take me through the wait. I want visually beautiful games (≠ realistic graphics; I hate most, btw), that have interesting and fun (can't be more specific, sorry) gameplay, I prefer simpler games with minimum: skill trees; leveling up; fetch and collect quests.. a good story is welcome, but isn't necessary, and I absolutely hate most difficult games, just games that are overwhelming, I want to relax, not work too hard. Now for the list of games I love: - Zelda: BotW (adore it, absolute favorite, 100+ hours) - Super Mario Odyssey - Nier:Automata - Limbo &amp;amp; Inside - Abzu Some expected recommendations I didn't enjoy: - The Witcher 3 - Dark Souls 3 - Bloodborne - The Last of Us I play on Switch, PS4, and PC.	games	Maria	1	0	0	0	0	1	NA	NA	0	NA	0	0	0	0	0	NA	0	1	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	1	0	0	0	0	0	0	1	1	NA	1	0	0	0	1	1	1	1	1	1	0	0	1	1	0	1	0	0	0	0	0	0	0
8qpzu6	[PC]The platformer game about a boy made of graffiti drawings	Hey guys, i forgot the year it's out, unfortunately, but i do remember it was at least on PC. This is what i also remember : - It's a platformer, jump and shoot, there is a boss at the end of a set of levels. - The settings of the game is at some urban city area, with hiphop music most of the time. - The character is actually a graffiti drawings, he is always sticked on a wall. He jumps and shoots other monster also made from graffiti drawings. I can't say if it's 2d or 3D platformer, because all of the time the character is sticked to the wall but sometimes camera changes as player jumps from one wall to another.

8rrn13	[PC] [~2005-2008] Extremely negatively received Painkiller-esque game developed in Eastern Europe	This game has been reviewed by IGN and was given a score of 2.0 or lower. I also distinctly remember a dodo-like enemy being featured in the screenshots of IGN's written review — if there's no IGN review with a bird, your looking at a wrong game. I'm fairly certain that the development studio was located in Moscow and the title was abstract, something like 'We Last Few' (not necessarily close, only an example). I haven't seen gameplay footage, the Painkiller connection has been made either in the reviews or by the developer.	games	Marijn	1	1	0	0	0	0	NA	NA	0	NA	0	0	0	0	0	NA	0	1	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	1	1	1	0	0	1	0	0	0	NA	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	1	0	0	1	0	1	1	0	0	0	1	0	0	0	0	0
8syj68	[PC] game with a scene in which a dragon is on top of a castle	This was released during the 2000s, before 2009 at most. I think it was an rpg, perhaps a jrpg, and I remember the main character had a rival or a partner. They were both human, but I think there was some magic involved. Another scene I remember is where there was a lot of red, maybe inside the dragon or something else? I don't remember much of the gameplay, but I think it involved hack 'n' slash.	games	Mette	1	1	0	0	0	1	NA	NA	1	NA	0	0	0	0	0	NA	0	1	0	0	0	0	1	0	0	1	0	1	0	0	0	0	0	0	NA	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	1	0	0	1	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0
8oziiy	Game Boy Advenure Game	**Platform(s):** Classic Gameboy **Genre:** (Fantasy) Adventure with RPG aspects (iirc) **Estimated year of release:** Played it way back between 95 and 2000, I want to say. **Graphics/art style:** As far as I remember you had your adventurer in the lower middle of the screen. You were able to advance one screen to the left, the right or upwards and often you had the choice between multiple of those. Often you had to fight enemies that were placed in front of your character. **Notable characters:** Don't remember. **Notable gameplay mechanics:** I know it had a password save system. When you wanted to stop you could use a menu item and it would show a alphanumerical password. When you wanted to continue your game, you had the option to load one of those states. **Other details:** I played it in my childhood in Germany. I can't remember whether it was German or English, but it was definitely released in the PAL region. I think I remember that you started your adventure into a forest. I am really lost and would love to see whether it is just nostalgica or whether this game was really any good.	games	Toine	1	0	0	0	1	1	NA	NA	0	NA	1	0	1	0	0	NA	0	1	0	0	0	0	1	1	0	1	0	1	0	0	0	0	0	0	NA	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	1	0	0	1	0	0	1	0	0	0	1	0	0	0	0	0
8p5xq9	[PS Windows 2000][2000's]Aquarium Game	**Platform(s):** Windows 2000, I'm pretty sure. NOT a browser flash game, but rather an installable game, I'm pretty sure. **Genre:** It's an aquarium game **Estimated year of release:** probably early to mid 2000's **Graphics/art style:** It's like a 3d game, the graphics were not bad for the time period, but I can't remember much beyond that **Notable characters:** So like one of the big things in the game is that if you manage to do really well taking care of your fish, making them very happy, you can unlock the mermaid, who you feed not with fish feed but with slices of pepperoni pizza. If your score goes down substantially though the mermaid will go away **Notable gameplay mechanics:** So like there's different fish feed you can feed your fish, and different kinds of feed have different effects on the fish. I can't remember any specific effects though, but you gotta like, sprinkle the feed in front of the fish so it sees the feed and goes for it. **Other details:** Most of the fish in the game are tropical fish, I think. Sorry I can't seem to remember much else about the game, but this is really all the details I can recall.	games	Marijn	1	1	0	0	1	1	NA	NA	0	NA	0	0	0	0	0	NA	0	1	0	0	0	0	1	0	0	1	0	1	0	0	0	0	0	0	NA	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	1	0	0	1	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0

8qdpe5	highest rated card games (or games with aspects from card games?) - detailed post	1. card games are one of the game i kinda like 1. one reason is **variety** 1. **variety** means multiple options 1. **one ongoing problem** is that it's hard to create variety while keeping balance 1. with balance, the multiple options are not unique and thus meaningless 1. **if a game is able to reach variety and balance that would be quite impressive** 1. variety &amp;amp; balance are important in all kinds of games, not just card games 1. so this isnt the reason why i like card game, since this isnt a unique reason -- 1. **discovery** of new parts of teh game (cards, actions, else) is important 2. but the newness of things disappears quickly 3. devs almost never can keep up content creation at the pace where it would override discovery 4. discovery is very difficult challenge 5. and i dont think there's any games in existence, or for a very long time that would have continuous discovery 1. the best solution for this would be that society that creates new games, but since there's very few ppl in society like that, and most ppl do essentially nothing, this wont happen 1. a society where most ppl are creating and innovating and doing productive things would solve this problem, but that is an extremely difficult goal of humanity 1. so discovery is not a sustainable thing --- ok so i realised this would turn out to be like 10-100 pages of explanations and details or something, and we're only 1/4th of a page into this topic, so im going to just stop here #what is the highest rated card game currently? to make sure the suggestion is good, check the ratings before recommending 80/100 or higher seems like an ok start http://www.metacritic.com/browse/games/score/metascore/year/pc?view=condensed&amp;amp;sort=desc http://www.metacritic.com/browse/games/score/metascore/all/xboxone/filtered?sort=desc&amp;amp;view=condensed http://store.steampowered.com/app/292030/The_Witcher_3_Wild_Hunt/ #any highly rated games that have elements of card games are good also? to make sure the suggestion is good, check the ratings before recommending	games	Mette	0	0	0	0	0	0	NA	NA	0	NA	0	0	0	0	0	NA	0	0	0	0	0	0	1	0	1	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	NA	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	1	1	1	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0

Year of Release: mid/late 90s- early 2000s (maybe) Graphics/Art: In my head I believe it was 2d blocky pixels Characters: can't recall any characters outside your ship and other ships Gameplay: You could travel to other planets to harvest materials and get items, but you never actually entered the planet. Ship upgrades like guns etc.. wanna say you could encounter aliens Other: I know this is terribly vague considering it sums up 90% of all space games, but it's been a very long time since I played it. I remember it having 3 panels one on left,bottom, and right with main screen in between them. Been trying to remember it for the past 2 years but my memory is shot. I could however pick it out from a screenshot I'm positive.	games	Marijn	1	1	0	0	1	1	NA	NA	0	NA	1	0	0	0	0	NA	0	1	0	0	0	0	1	0	0	1	0	1	0	0	0	0	0	0	NA	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	1	0	0	1	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0

8rwzxd	Looking for a Game to play	I use to play a game a LONG time ago Darkswords.com (back when it was just .eu). I liked the game and it's mechanics. I was wondering if anyone knows of a game out there similar to this? I would go back to this one, but for personal beliefs on how matters were handed with the game (not inside the game, the rights to the game, ect) I don't think I will be. So who has any good suggestions? and if not exactly similar, the grouping/party system is what I'm mainly looking for. You group up with the party leader and the Leader is the only one that moves around and can take your party places, whenever anyone attacks anything everyone auto attacks as well minus abilities.	games	Vivien	1	0	0	0	1	0	NA	NA	0	NA	0	0	0	0	0	NA	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	NA	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	1	0	1	0	0	1	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0
8racoi	I just got PS4 and I need to know what console exclusives are actually worth it.	I want to make it clear, it doesn't need to be PS4 exclusive. Just (current gen) console exclusive. Also no remasters. While they're great, most likely I've played them already on PSX/2/3/PC/whatever. If it's on PC, it's not exactly what I'm looking for here. Been hunting good PC games for last, I dunno, 20 years. I'm always up for recommendations for good games but right now I'm looking for what I've missed because I didn't have access to them. So, I don't have no Xbox, PC is all I've really needed, but got off PS4 Pro for cheap just like I did back in the days with PS3 and The Last of Us Part 2 got announced so I figured why the hell not. I've been looking up something for years already but I'm so stupid I didn't make a list. Some console exclusives I figured would be worth getting to give you an idea what I'm looking for: 1. The Last of Us 2, I loved pt 1. 2. God of War seems to be hot topic 3. Horizon Zero Dawn 4. Uncharted 4 is something I've been looking at too. I already have NHL 18 (-80% lol), and The Last Guardian I got from a friend. I know there are a *ton* of others I've seen and even more that I haven't, but can't just remember right now. On PS3 I loved the following games, that made it worth a buy, just to give more examples: 1. The Last of Us 1 1. Metal Gear Solid 1-4. I had played previous installments god knows how many times already with my friends but nothing beats owning them yourself. 1. Beyond: Two Souls 1. Heavy Rain 1. Dragons Dogma (back when it was console exclusive, got it on PC too) 1. FFXIII + the rest. Hang me haters. Also got PC versions of these. 1. Tekken Tag Tournament 2 and Tekken 3 were hot AF And again, most likely a ton that I'm forgetting. Sorry for rambling, I tried to make the post clear but apparently I have difficulties with that.

Other details:the ending was very headscratching and featured what appeared to be a moonbase with a creepy looking angry character breaking the camera with which the player sees the image.

Very rounded and cartoony. **Notable characters:** The main character was a purple or maybe blueish anthropomorphic bug. iirc it had detached hands kind of like rayman? There were also enemies that reminded me of the goombas from Mario a little bit? **Notable gameplay mechanics:** iirc the objective was to complete some task to progress to the next level although I don't remember specifically what. There were collectible gems and some of the puzzles required the use of bombs to solve them. There were also boulders that would fall if the block underneath them was removed which could be used to kill enemies. **Other details:** tbqh I was kinda convinced this game was just a weird feverdream until my dad said he remembered it too.

'I think' my memory is a little fuzzy. but this is the style of game play that develops throughout the game. there are multiple endings if i recollect.

8spwgx	90's game Mutants and Overminds on an Island	Only played on PC through game client known as RealArcade, later bought out by Big Fish Games Genre: Isometric shooter (evocative of Fallout 1 style) although I played a particularly pacifist style (by taking abilities in a what I recall as a fairly standard talent tree system in which I invested points related to interacting with mutants, specifically mutants that sold items) 1990s? Mid- if I had to pin any degree of specificity Very evocative of Fallout 1 if I recall correctly I recall there being an Overmind, or an individual who perhaps went by another name but regardless controlled all the *literal* giant brains controlling each of the sequentially locked levels. I remember specifically 'speccing' into interacting with the mutants on the island and getting either the ability to interact with some of them as merchants or getting better prices for the merchant mutants. (*and also not needing most, if not all of what they sold) I distinctly remember travelling to an island, progressing through levels in a linear fashion (completing 1 level by progressing past the overseer giant brain ruling a given level) before going to the next set stage (though I don't recall any specific differences between stages) The playable character arrives on an island (which I do not think the PC leaves, though I did not finish the game.) via a fabricated creature I distinctly remember as being 'very much like Lapras'' I played this game on a PC through a game service on my mother's PC called RealPlayer (90% sure RealArcade, 100% sure it is no longer called by that name, almost certainly out by BigFishGames. The island (as far as I progressed) was populated by mutants which were created (or otherwise influenced) by on Overmind. I remember mutants which were analogous to people and mutants which were analogous to cows. I also remember merchants and urns or similar pottery which held loot and were susceptible to looting (by breaking [think Diablo]) I played this game through a client called RealArcade which was bought out by BigFishGames and have been unable to locate this game for a relatively very long time.

All the enemies were simple geometric shapes, with some of them having something like helicopter blades, and I remember one boss being a huge purple rhombus Notable gameplay mechanics: I'm pretty sure it was just a simple shooting game.

8ocqh3	[PC] [Early-mid 2000’s] Point and click game where you look for dinosaurs in a cave	I went through a dinosaur fascination growing up. I had this giant collection of dinosaur toys, books, movies, and video games, including one game which came on a disc for the PC. To the best of my knowledge, it was a point-and-click game where you were trapped in a cave and had to search the cave and find all the dinosaur species before you could escape. There was the voice of someone, who I’m assuming was a paleontologist or scientist, guiding you through the cave and congratulating you whenever you found a dinosaur. However, if you walked into the wrong “room” of the cave, a T-Rex would pop out and kill you, making you start the game over. I was around 5 or 6 when I played the game, meaning I played it in 2005, though it may have been made earlier. I probably don’t have it anymore, as I gave a lot of my PC games away after I got a gaming laptop and Steam. Has anyone else here played this game before? Do you remember the name of it? Please let me know.	games	Marijn	1	1	0	1	1	0	NA	NA	1	NA	1	0	0	0	0	NA	0	1	0	0	0	0	1	0	0	1	0	1	0	0	0	0	0	0	NA	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	1	0	0	1	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0

8ss7p7	Games like Factorio and ONI?	I love sim games, management games, resource manipulation, money making, anything like that. These two games have sucked me in super hard but I also love all the Sim City games, Computer Tycoon. I like building, managing, producing, shipping, surviving, etc. I love Oxygen Not Included because of how granular it is. Managing water, power gases (Oxygen, Hydrogen, Carbon Dixoide, etc.), managing temperature, insulation, spreading of germs and disease. Gathering, Mining and refining resources. Managing workers. Setting up automation and self feeding/propelling systems. All this amongst tons of other game systems to dabble in. It speaks to me on a spiritual level. I’m looking for more though. Any suggestions.	games	Marijn	1	0	0	0	1	0	NA	NA	0	NA	0	0	0	0	1	NA	0	1	0	0	0	0	1	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	NA	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	1	0	1	0	0	1	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0
8qd4k5	Battle Royale games with classes + RPG elements?	Realm Royale is one that I know of and it's pretty good (and will probably get way better with updates) but I'm kind of hoping for one that has a lot of classes with distinct / unique playstyles. Kind of like Mineplex (I think that was the name, haven't played it in years) but without the god-awful combat and mechanics of Minecraft. Another example would be Black Survival but it's pretty much a turn-based game. Might be a long shot since most BRs are modern / post-apo shooters but it's worth a try!	games	Toine	1	0	0	0	1	0	NA	NA	0	NA	0	0	0	0	0	NA	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	1	0	NA	0	0	0	0	1	0	0	1	0	1	0	0	1	0	0	0	0	0	1	0	0	0	1

Any games like it? Also looking for something that has a similar gameplay to the mage in gauntlet. Can be other top-down view games as well, even though they're not my thing usually, that was one I really liked. I usually find them too disengaged from what I'm actually doing for some reason. Never really liked grim dawn/titan quest much. I really liked Sacred for some reason though.	games	Maria	1	0	0	0	1	0	NA	NA	0	NA	0	0	0	0	1	NA	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	1	0	NA	1	0	0	0	0	0	0	1	0	1	0	0	1	1	0	1	0	0	0	0	0	0	0

8rsj4a	NES Medieval Puzzel Side-scroller	This is killing me right now.... This game was an unlicensed cartridge and kind of looked like Gouls n Ghosts / Ghosts n Gobblins. It was a medieval side scrolling puzzel game and I think somehow fairies and or naked-lady statues played into it. I believe you were collecting them. Also, you couldn't jump and had to collect things / do things in a certain order or else you could get trapped and had to wait for the timer to countdown. It totally wasn't Solomon's Key. I think the name had Death or Dark or Lord in the title but all combinations of those words have not helped me find this game. BTW - this game wasn't awesome or anything (graphics were pretty good!), It was more frustrating than anything but it popped into my head last night (high AF) and now I can't shake it!!	games	Toine	1	1	0	0	1	1	NA	NA	0	NA	0	0	1	1	0	NA	0	1	0	1	0	0	1	0	0	1	0	0	0	0	1	0	1	1	NA	0	0	0	1	0	0	0	1	0	0	1	0	1	1	0	1	0	0	0	0	0	0	0

8qe2py	[PC][2000]2D platformer in a fantasy world	Platforms: PC Genre: 2D platformer Estimated year of release: between 1998-2005 Graphics/art style: It is in 2D anime cartoon style. The worlds were mostly bright colored. I remember a level on a pirate ship, you would jump across the ship defeating pirates. There is also a level where you have to climb up a giant green bean stalk. Notable characters: I distincly remember the story went like this. A human boy woke up at night to an elf like boy with (I think) green hair to help save his fantasy world. They sort of fuse and I thought one of the characters name was Coco. Notable gameplay mechanics: as the fusion boy who saves the world you had to defeat enemies. I remember this could be done by shooting fireballs out of your hands. You could also do a kick on the ground. When jumping and kicking you could infinitly jump around doing roundhouse kicks. If you would also press the command to shoot fireballs, it would causd you to jump while roundhousing while also shooting fireballs. Other details: In the pirate ship level there was a girl in the background you could somehow interact with and receive a kiss from. I'm not sure but I think the Icon of the game on my desktop looked like a pineapple. There was a way using cheat codes to unlock al the different levels. Iirc there were around 5 or 7. Thank you very much, I would love to see this piece of nostalgia again!	games	Marijn	1	1	0	0	1	1	NA	NA	1	NA	1	0	0	0	0	NA	1	1	0	0	0	0	1	0	0	1	0	1	0	0	0	0	1	1	NA	0	0	0	1	0	0	0	1	0	0	1	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	1	0	1	0	0
8rvyq4	Looking for a micromanagement game	However, it's a bit tougher than Cities or Banished. I want something where basic skills are built (say, woodcutting or stone mining), progression is stable (upgrading, skills, science etc), difficulty is entirely adjustable (not unfair), and the eventual goal isn't just 'get big or get bored.' Something similar to progression in games like Haven and Hearth or They Are Millions, or Dwarf Fortress, but without the insane entry gate. Similar derivatives (gnomoria, kittens game) aren't particularly helpful. If you know one, shoot! For closer comparison, think of Dwarf Fortress, Factorio, or They Are Millions... but not those ones, and without that huge skillset needed to know what you're doing.

8shia2	[PC] Farming Game With a Truck	**Platform(s):** PC **Genre:** Top Down a Farming Game **Estimated year of release:** 2005's (?) **Graphics/art style:** Cartoonish Drawings **Notable characters:** a Barber, a Greengrocer who both lives in town **Notable gameplay mechanics:** Every day you collect resources from your farm with your truck and produce products which you sell them in town **Other details:** As I said in above every morning of the new day you collect resources from your farm and move them to produce products. You never leave your truck and if you collect them fast enough you can make combos. Also every evening you go to the town to sell your products. Again you never leave your truck and you can also make combos same way as morning. When you enough money you can buy more lands to produce more products. For example you start with a wheat field. You take wheat every morning and transport it to wind mill to produce flour. At the evenings you sell flour to local bakery. When you buy your bakery you can use flour to produce breads and etc. to sell town's cafe. This is a top down game. You look from sky to ground. I also remember you can buy fishery, apple orchard and many more fields.

What I'm looking for is something where you have a job and a fleet of tools and equipment to do it, bonus points if the jobsite is remote and you gotta transport stuff back and forth. I know there's probably plenty of games here but the only one i can think of that might meet the requirements is that gold mining simulator thing, i don't remember the title of it though.

I don't want to say shooter because there wasn't much shooting involved, maybe some slashing? **Estimated year of release:** Late 90s. **Graphics/art style:** It had a sinister atmosphere. The game was in 3D. **Notable characters:** I sadly don't recall any. I think the main character is some angelic thing. **Notable gameplay mechanics:** **Other details:** What I remember most vividly was a specific level / stage where you'd walk though a hallway that felt... organic. It was like walking through a bloody pulsating gut, but that's mostly my only impression of the game. I vaguely remember that the walking along a hallway was a very repetitive theme.	games	Toine	1	1	0	0	1	1	NA	NA	0	NA	1	0	1	0	0	NA	0	1	0	0	0	0	1	0	0	1	0	1	0	0	0	0	1	0	NA	0	0	0	1	0	0	0	1	0	0	1	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0

I’ve been playing a lot of day of infamy and really enjoy it but I like campaign modes when I don’t feel like only playing multiplayer and I enjoy the story and missions. One of my favorite games of all time was MOH: rising sun for the original Xbox, but I’m on PC now and haven’t been able to find anything on steam that fits the bill. I’ve seen MOH: allied assault and heard it was good, but it’s not on steam, I’m fine getting through origin or gog, if anyone can vouch for whether or not it’s worth it. I’m fine with outdated graphics, as long as the gameplay and story are good enough.

The part of the game we played was set in a village with wooden buildings and paths, in a wooded area. Dialogue between characters may have also been similar to Pokemon, but my memories could be bleeding together a bit. **Notable characters:** I believe we played as the protagonist who was a boy with brown hair, I think there was a wolf involved somehow as an enemy **Notable gameplay mechanics:** The town we were in was open to be explored, I think we engaged with some wild animals in turn-based battle. **Other details:** Spirits may have been involved in the storyline or maybe some wild animals were uncharacteristically attacking the town. Something was going on, and the protagonist had to figure out the situation in classic adventure style.

8qqcrs	Game similar to Wiz 101	I used to love playing wizard 101 as a kid but the thing I really enjoyed was the pvp. I liked the strategy and how you needed to be able to predict your opponents next play. I’m looking for a game that has that similar style of pvp (doesn’t need to an rpg game, most likely some card game). I’ve tried hearthstone but it’s not really the same because there’s no buffs or debuffs which you can put on yourself or opponent. I also really enjoyed having different armor and weapons which made you better in certain categories and the different schools which created different types of play styles. Doesn’t need to be an exact match but any suggestions would be appreciated.	games	Maria	1	0	0	0	1	0	NA	NA	0	NA	0	0	0	0	0	NA	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	NA	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	1	0	1	0	0	1	1	0	1	0	0	1	0	0	0	1

8sdb0u	A PC shooter I used to watch my dad playing as a kid	Platforms: PC Genre: First Person Shooter Estimated Year of Release: 1999-2003 Graphics/Art Style: Possibly 64 bit, futuristic or industrial setting Notable Characters: Big mech/robot enemies Notable Gameplay Mechanics: Stopping said mechs by using a computer Other Details: I originally posted this on r/HelpMeFind and was told this may be a better place to ask. My details on this one are blurry. As a kid I remember watching my dad play a lot of games on his PC but one always sticks out because it always interested me. What I remember is that it was a first person shooter. I don't remember what enemies there were except one - a giant mech. I don't remember how big it was exactly but I remember that it was very slow. It took its steps very slowly as it tried to go after you. One detail that I feel very certain and yet also cautious of was how it was beaten. There were green computers and when you used them the mech was stopped. It either shut down or blew up, I can't remember, but this is the detail that sticks in my mind the most because I specifically remember being in the playground with my friends and essentially role-playing this game and I definitely made them go to a green computer to defeat a giant robot. I don't know how much of that is accurate but it sticks out in my mind. There are a few other details floating around. I think one of the green computers was on top of something you had to climb up (maybe a stack of barrels or crates) and the mech was chasing you through a corridor out into a small, open area outside where the computer was. And this may have been from a different game but I think I remember a lizard-y alien thing in some sort of water area. As for the time, I must have between 2 and 6 years old when I saw it. That would have put it anywhere between 1999 and 2003. I don't remember the graphics, I am inclined to say 64 bit but I don't know. I have tried to explain as best as possible with the vague details I have in my head.

I absolutely loved the boss fights in the Dark Souls franchise \(ESPECIALLY DSIII\) because of the huge monsters, grand orchestral music, and flashy visuals. I'm looking for games with more of that. However, epic fights like these are not that common in other RPG games. Skyrim had me dicking around in caves fighting Draugr, and Witcher 3 is largely just fighting packs of monsters in the forest and stuff.

The circles are properties that a player can buy and upgrade. There are also certain circles that the player can land on to destroy other player's buildings.

8rme9k	Mystery/Quest game on PC	Hi all! I am...not a gamer, but I'd like to explore gaming at my own pace once in a while. The only game I have fully played was The Messenger in the early 00's, and I loved it: the historical settings that matched the actual buildings of the period, the scientific experiments that actually took place. I still think about it, even though at the time I found it difficult.. I recently tried Dream Daddy, but it didn't grab my attention. Ultimately I'd prefer something light-hearted (I remember a PC game in black and white where in the end you were trapped in someone's head because they were in a coma after being abused...never again man). Honestly I have no interest in violence/gore/horror or anything co-op. Another little kink: I have quite poor vision - I know it sounds dumb, but if things take place in a dark setting, there's a good chance I'm missing half the action.	games	Toine	1	0	0	0	0	1	NA	NA	0	NA	1	0	0	1	0	NA	1	1	0	0	0	0	1	0	0	1	0	1	0	0	0	0	1	0	NA	1	0	0	0	0	1	1	1	0	1	0	0	1	0	0	0	0	0	1	0	0	0	1

8qspqq	Repost [PC][90s] Anti stealing/drug/gang game.	I’m listing OP’s description of the game here because it’s much more thorough than the details I remember but I know for a fact it’s the game I’m looking for: I remember playing this game in the mid-90s on the PC that was incredibly blunt with it's messages against drugs, gangs and theft. It was a cartoon style. There were three characters and each one represented each different problem. My memory is hazy, but I think I recall the drug guy being tall and maybe red (I remember that if you win, he quits drugs and becomes a pole vaulter), the gang guy was big, blue and violent and the thief was a green woman. I remember that in order to win, you had to collect pieces of each of the character's mind and put it together for them so they could come to their senses and quit breaking the law and being a bad citizen. I never had time to get the minds of the gang guy and shoplifter. I only remember one specific scene in the game, it was with the drug user and he was showing the kids in the game how to sniff airplane glue out of a paper bag. The whole game barely pulled punches with showing the guy strung out and jonesing. That's all I can remember, the gameplay was mainly watching scenes of bad stuff, and why it's bad and shouldn't do it. I remember one mini game where it teaches you about gang colors, and you shouldn't wear gang colors, and it consisted of a choosing a color not related to a gang.	games	Vivien	1	1	0	0	1	1	NA	NA	0	NA	0	0	0	0	1	NA	0	1	0	0	0	0	1	0	0	1	0	1	0	0	0	0	0	0	NA	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	1	0	0	1	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0

8q7btc	[Windows XP/7][2005-15]Looking for a 3d game where you have a monster arm and can fight and tame lizard monsters	**Platform(s):** Either Windows XP or Windows 7 **Genre:** Action **Estimated year of release:** 2000-2015. **Graphics/art style:** Prologue introduction might have been 2d realistic artstyle, depicting an apocalypse (or an accident, as there might've been a van on its side). Gameplay was 3d. **Notable characters:** Main character was a male with a monster arm. And it might've grown to more of his body as the game progressed, at least on his status bar **Notable gameplay mechanics:** It was probably top down Point-of-View. Enemies were lizard monsters varying in size and there was a mechanic to actually have them follow you. They moved on four legs. Your monster arm was shown at the top-right(maybe) and as you got stronger it covered more of your body. ALSO, just remembered, I think there was a representation of your Energy/Stamina in the form of (red?)spheres (over your head?) You gained more over time and enemies probably had it as well. **Other details:** The name of the game was likely a single word. I thought it was 'Monster' for sure, and the fact that I can't find it anywhere is weird. I played this game definitely after 2005, and definitely before 2015. If I had to guess, somewhere around 2010.

The other thing I remember is that the game had a mode where both teams would try and take control of a launchpad, and whatever team held it for a total of 5 minutes launched the rocket and won the game. The game had a similar look to the game 'Loadout' but it was probably made 4 years before that game.

I believe it takes place in a large castle or mansion, and each floor you go to has an educational mini game or two to beat before advancing. Once you clear the final floor, you obtain one robot, and must repeat the steps to gain the rest, or something like that.

Easy to pick up and play by even non gamers. 2. Each play/game won't take more than 5-10 minutes. 3. Built in scoreboard to add name/initials with your score. 4. Ideally runs on a Windows machine and compatible with an Xbox 360 controller. Idea is to have a single player game that an office of 50+ people can take turns playing and the folks with the top 3 scores will win a prize. Any recommendations?

Commodore64 ~1984 Side view plane flying game, where you could shoot bullets out of the front of the plane, and drop bombs down. The screen would be static and did not scroll. You would wrap around and appear on the other side of the screen instead. You could play as 1 or 2 players, and it was a lot easier with 2 players. The point of the game was to shoot a hole through a boat using bombs. When you dropped a bomb, it would remove a 'square' from the boat. Other AI planes flew around shooting at you.

Now, one thing I remember was the the description of one the wizards you encounter. Basically, he was all-powerful, being able to destroy a city with a thought.

Genre: First person shooter Platform: 90 percent certain it was on the PC Estimated year of release: 2010s Graphics: the game was dark, full of metal corridors: likely taking place in a space station. This may be my mind inserting things into blank spaces, but I think I remember players having lights on their suits. Notable gameplay mechanics: The game was multiplayer, and you would be completing a mission on a space station/vessel infested by aliens. The aliens could burst through walls, and you could seal doors to hold them off. If I remember correctly, if you died, you respawned as a new individual, but I could very easily be wrong.	games	Toine	1	1	0	0	1	1	NA	NA	0	NA	1	0	0	0	0	NA	0	1	0	0	0	0	1	0	0	1	0	1	0	0	0	0	1	0	NA	0	0	0	1	0	0	0	1	0	0	1	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	1	0	0	0	1
8sn1cp	Games that take you from rookie to pro (zero to hero, nobody to celebrity)	I'm wondering where all the great story/career progression games have gone lately. Games that ask you to work from being a newbie, someone who has never participated in the sport or story before and works their way to being the best. Games like **Tiger Woods PGA Tour 2007**. I remember that this game had you play with no sponsors, low stats, coming low in the tournaments and not even getting close to pro status for ages. You had to get better, work harder, train certain areas of your game slowly gain sponsorships etc to progress. And it was a 30 year career. Or **Need for Speed Underground/2** that had you start as a low level street racer, working your way through different tiers of racers, competing for pink slips, going to the custom shops to get better specs for the cars you owned to work your way up in notoriety and fame. **NFL Street** that had you pinking players from a roster with a small amount of money and building the team up. Each year you get better and better, with a stronger team to take on whatever championship there was. And **Fight Night Round 3** that had you start as a rookie in a crappy ring fighting local matches, training each aspect of the fight in mini games working up to the big times of the heavyweight. Albeit none of these games are perfect (far from it) but I always remember them fondly for throwing me in with the lowest levels/teams and having me work hard to get to the big leagues. I can think of 2 recent games that do that and one of them is a mobile game. Punch Club is a great wee fighting simulator/manager that has your street fight your way to the top. And the mobile game is Christian West's Motorsport Manager. Games these days seemingly drop you in as a Pro and have you running the main stage as a real world person. Can anyone suggest newer games (last 5\~ years) that have this sort of feeling of working up to a pro. Doesn't have to necessarily be sports related, these are just the ones I can remember off the top of my head.	games	Toine	1	0	0	0	1	0	NA	NA	1	NA	0	0	1	0	0	NA	1	1	0	0	0	0	1	0	0	0	0	1	0	0	0	0	1	0	NA	0	0	0	0	1	0	0	1	0	1	0	0	1	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0

You got on of 3 objects from this 'maze' and had to choose among 3 different paths \(left, right, middle\). The left one you would be in the sky and try to throw rocks at a little demon. The middle one you would fall into a cauldron in the kitchen of the devil. The right one you would become a fish and play that game 'big fish eats little fish'. If you chose the right object, you could escape. It had many endings and in some you would die and become a little ghost.

PC FPS Early 2000's realistic style graphics No notable characters It was a typical first person shooter. Not very talented tactical like most SWAT games. It did NOT belong to the standard SWAT franchise although I'm sure it had 'SWAT' in the name.

There was a round floating alien and I remember a large beefy looking one, I think he had guns for arms and horns on his head like a bull. The game was DEFINITELY not DOOM. No other details.	games	Mette	1	0	0	0	1	1	NA	NA	1	NA	0	0	0	0	0	NA	0	1	0	0	1	0	1	0	0	1	0	1	0	0	1	0	1	0	NA	0	0	0	1	0	0	0	1	0	0	1	0	0	1	0	1	0	0	0	0	0	0	0
8syf7w	Snake game on different planets	Platform: I'm almost positive i played it on a pc and it didn't require downloading it or having anything like steam bc I was young and definitely wouldn't have known how to do any of that. Genre: I don't know video game genres but it would go in whatever genre the regular snake game is in... It's single player and you move the snake around until you either run into something on the planet or yourself. Estimated year of release: i played it probably between 2007-2012 but once again I'm not sure :/ Graphics/art style: it was animated and cartoony, there were different planets/levels you could play on and each was cute and cartoony in the same style just different things on the planets. I remember very clearly one of the levels was a tennis ball and you'd just move the snake around this cartoon tennis ball... I feel like this isn't really helpful but I don't really know how else to describe it. Notable characters: I can't remember if their were other characters besides the snake which you played as but I'm pretty sure there weren't. Notable game play mechanics: you'd move the snake around I don't remember if it's with the mouse or the keyboard but the planet would rotate so the screen is always right on top of the snake as it moved. I wish I remembered more, I totally forgot it existed until just now and I can't remember anything besides what I've written here and that I know I definitely played it for hours... I hope somebody out here can help me so I can relive it :) thank you for your time	games	Vivien	1	1	0	0	1	1	NA	NA	0	NA	1	0	0	0	0	NA	0	1	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	1	0	1	0	0	0	0	0	0	NA	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	1	0	0	1	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	1	0	0	0	1
8rim24	[PC][2012-2014?]First-Person Puzzle Hacking game	**Platform(s):** PC **Genre:** First-Person, Puzzle, Atmospheric **Estimated year of release:** 2012-2014? Was unreleased at the time **Graphics/art style:** Command terminals, black &amp;amp; white 3D environments, glitchy visuals **Notable characters:** None **Notable gameplay mechanics:** The intro of the game required the player to enter commands into a command terminal in order to enter the game. The 3D portion required the player to position themselves in specific spots in the world and view glitched structures from certain angles in order to reconstruct them. **Other details:** From what I recall, the game's title was an acronym. The whole concept was something along the lines of having to connect to a server/computer and virtually enter it, repairing broken pieces of it as mentionned in mechanics in order to fix the corruption/glitches. The last time I saw it, it was in heavy development and no longer downloadable (this was something around the year I've mentionned). The intro of the game was a puzzle in itself, requiring the player to figure out various commands to prepare a connection to the virtual world via a command terminal. Upon figuring it out, it'd slowly power up with fancy visuals and sound effects before putting the player into a 3D world in first-person.	games	Mette	1	0	1	0	1	1	NA	NA	1	NA	0	1	0	0	0	NA	0	1	0	0	0	0	1	0	0	1	0	1	1	0	1	0	1	0	NA	0	0	0	1	0	0	0	1	0	0	1	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0

One game in particular was about a team sent on a planet/Island occupied by humanoid robots that resemble B1 Battle Droids. I'm not sure if it was Star Wars but a little part of me thinks it wasn't. It was 4 person team where you can switch between characters. I played on a Trial Version of it and my memory is quite hazy.

8onw5n	[PC][Mid to late 2000s] Team fortress type flash game	**Genre:** Multiplayer, Shooter **Estimated year of release:** I played this game a lot late 2000's, but it may have released earlier **Graphics/art style:** You viewed everything with a bird's eye view. The map was a bunch of square tiles, with grass, dirt, wall, floor tiles. The classes were basically a rectangle body with a circle head on top and a weapon to the side, and the shapes had a few extra detailed lines that made it easy to distinguish classes. **Notable characters:** You could pick a variety of classes. The one's I remember were 1\) The heavy, which had a minigun 2\) What I call the guardian, which had a shield that stopped bullets. 3\) The lancer which had a rod and did bonus damage to heavy and guardian, 4\) Medic, which healed and had a shotgun 5\) A basic soldier class with an AR and grenades 6\) The fucking assasin which could one\-shot #3\-5 with a melee and is invisible until he's near an enemy. If the lag was bad I would just instantly die to the assassin without seeing him. These class names were really generic so using them to google search gave me a bunch of games I wasn't looking for **Notable gameplay mechanics:** There were a few game modes. I think there was capture the flag, death match, and a king of the hill. Classes had a primary and secondary weapon, and a melee attack.	games	Vivien	1	1	0	0	1	1	NA	NA	0	NA	0	0	0	0	0	NA	1	1	0	0	0	0	1	0	0	1	0	1	0	0	0	0	1	0	NA	0	0	0	1	0	0	0	1	0	0	1	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	1	0	0	0	1

Poles and mattress when turning left and right for boost. Use L2/R2 (or L1/R1, I forgot) to extend hand to grab the poles or hit the mattress. 3. Vaulting over walls, among other things for shortcuts. 4. (Maybe?) Character can slide too. 5. Castle as the final race track vs. the princess 6. A Japanese forest as one of the track vs. the Kappa creature. 7. Even though it's single player, the race will do a split screen from time to time to see where your opponent is. **Other details:** 1. It's not Running High. I checked and it's not it. 2. [Post-submit] The Japan-Exclusive thing is not 100% sure, but the game was in Japanese when I played it so I assumed it's a Japan-only game.	games	Toine	1	1	0	0	1	1	NA	NA	0	NA	1	0	1	0	0	NA	0	1	0	1	0	0	1	1	0	1	0	0	0	0	0	0	1	0	NA	0	0	0	1	0	0	0	1	0	0	1	0	0	1	0	1	0	0	1	0	1	0	1

8rlxc7	Story oriented FPS with a simple gameplay, (can be an old one).	Hi guys, I'm looking for an easy-to-play, story-driven FPS. * I loved the half life serie, especially the easy and satisfying gameplay, like you run, you shoot something, jump over some obstacle, toss a grenade or whatever, it's fast, and doesn't feel clunky. And the story is good too * In the same spirit I loved Bioshock one and Bioshock infinite for the same reasons. * I liked the borderlands series, and the far cry series too, for their system of objectives in an open world game, but a corridor game doesn't bother me. * I played the last two tomb raider but didn't finish the last one because it felt quite heavy and slow/clunky. * I tried Dishonored but didn't finish it because stealth without shooting someone is not something I really enjoy in games (and I neved had enough poisoned darts to play satisfyingly with the crossbow :( ) So yeah i'm kind of stuck replaying obscure mod of half life 1 which is exactly the gameplay I'm looking for, simple, quick and concise. Oh and I'm in the middle of crysis 2 but it feels like a hassle to play it, can't really pinpoint why tho. I feel like the story isn't that great and fighting just one kind of foes isn't great. Open for any suggestions, don't worry about the graphics as long as it's at least equivalent to half life 1.	games	Toine	1	0	0	0	1	1	NA	NA	0	NA	0	0	0	0	0	NA	1	1	0	0	0	0	1	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	1	1	NA	0	0	0	1	0	0	0	1	0	1	0	0	1	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0

There were some walkways to the ceiling inside of it, and some buildings to the side that you could get to using the walkways. Spawn points for both teams were centered around medium-sized buildings to either side of the hangar. There was a high road you get to that ran along one side of the hangar to snipe at people and flank the spawn points. There may have been vehicles? **Other details:**	games	Maria	1	0	0	0	1	1	NA	NA	0	NA	1	0	0	0	0	NA	0	1	0	0	0	0	1	0	0	0	0	1	0	0	0	0	1	0	NA	0	0	0	1	0	0	0	1	0	0	1	0	0	1	1	0	0	0	1	0	0	0	1

I remember it being a flash game I used to play on friv.com, but I don’t remember much else other than a water level where you have to collect a certain amount of something to move on, and there were streams pushing you down different paths. The flower guy also wore a scuba mask while underwater if that helps. There was a sky level with an icon that was a rainbow, and a level where you have to jump in between trees and avoid what I think were squirrels.

8om3w8	[PS2/360] [2000-2010] Tactical Rpg involving being a Mercenary helping various Nations fight eachother in the form of side missions to move the plot	Platform(s): ps2, possibly 360 (owned both at the time) Genre: Tactical Rpg, set characters as party Estimated year of release: 2000ish, seemed like one of those late game ps2 era rpgs Graphics/art style: hand drawn art for portraits, chibi 3d avatars made popular by final fantasy tactics and Disgaea. The maps follow a similar pattern, being block based for distance and levels for platforms. Notable characters: I remember there being at least 5 factions, each with a handful of characters each. There was a Catholic/noble knight faction you start working with for the first mission, with a robed old man as the Leader. There was an Underworld geoup, with a bare chested animalistic man and a big chested woman as it's leaders. There was an eastern empire with multiple young girls as its generals. There was a Elven nation, which if I remember correctly had a mage with a floppy bunny ear hat with a crucifix shaped staff. There was also an evil empire, with a vampire looking dude that looked like a castlevania rip off. For the main party I remember there being two male heroes, a blond and a brunette both in standard boring armor. There was also a female sidekick healer. The only Unique character I remember that wasn't from a conquered nation was a tan girl raised by goblins, with a studded club as a weapons and the verbal tick 'Gobli Gobli'. I didn't beat the game, but it seemed like the main villain was a giant flaming demon monster that was possessing a child. I remember the reveal mission had them find Tue child in a burning village, and he started crying until he exploded into a demon form that was invincible. Notable gameplay mechanics: There was a big focus on having a normal sized party against many enemy units. Most of the non main mission quests were set types of jobs to help one nation attack another nation. Like 'cut off supplies' or 'capture enemy general'. On the fields there were glowing runes that had different effects, and were the main way to gain the advantage in a fight. I also remember you could explode the runes to cause other runes to change effects in some way. Beyond that it honestly played mostly like a squaresoft tactical dog with equip item slots and generic skills and magic. Other details: mainly I remember that the game was a sequel, either 2 or 3 in the series. I also remember the board was a brownish red background with the main heroes overlapping into a L shape, like how a lot of dog titles used to show character faces. It had a really artsy but forgettable name, like resonance of fate or infinite undiscovery. But my memory is vague so that may be wrong	games	Maria	1	1	0	0	1	1	NA	NA	1	NA	0	0	0	0	0	NA	0	1	0	1	1	0	1	0	0	1	0	1	0	0	0	0	0	0	NA	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	1	0	0	1	0	1	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0

8pbuum	Cannot think of the name of this game.	So this game is around I think 2002 - 2005 area, I remember the main menu is of a castle in the dark with bright torches lighting it up. It is an ARPG, first person. the first part when you start is outside roam around a bit then find some goblins that lead to a door, you cannot get through it, so you have to go into this sewer system with slimes and chests you can lock pick which eventually leads to some scaffolding above the water to get by. You fight through more goblins till you get to I think a cave troll in what looks like an opera room or something, you kill it and it then leads to a decently expansive town with another cave troll caught in a cage and several quests about a card system I think from a Goblin. After roaming around the city you are suppose to go into a crypt and kill a ghost or you are attacked by ghost summons and even in the city you start getting attacked by assassins or some weird summons after awhile, which then eventually the cave troll breaks free and you have to kill it then it leads you out into a wilderness area. I know most of this is extremely vague, but this is all I can really remember, but I want to play this again pretty bad because I remember it being really fun, very oblivion esque, but I think it came out before it.	games	Vivien	1	0	1	0	1	0	NA	NA	0	NA	1	0	0	0	0	NA	0	1	0	0	0	0	1	0	0	0	0	1	0	0	0	0	1	0	NA	0	0	0	1	0	0	0	1	0	0	1	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	1	0	0	0	1

Might aim archers. No scrolling, as far as I can recall. **Other details:** If you throw one stickman in the air and they fall down, there's blood animations like they spatter around and turn flat. It's around a castle with green grass. There is a power up system, or not-I don't remember. There could be ones that fly or something, but I do remember giant stickmen.	games	Toine	1	1	0	0	1	1	NA	NA	0	NA	0	0	0	0	0	NA	0	1	0	0	0	0	1	0	0	1	0	1	0	0	0	0	1	0	NA	0	0	0	1	0	0	0	1	0	0	1	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0
8p1dz9	GTA like game on PC	**Platform(s):** PC/Windows **Genre:** Third\-person shooter **Estimated year of release:** early 2000s **Graphics/art style:** Very similar to GTA III, 'realistic' colors/art style. **Notable characters:** There was a part in a nightclub (dimly lighted, purple club lights) where you fight a guy that shoots at you from the stage with a tommy gun. After you've defeated him there was a cutscene where he sits on the floor with his back against the wall and you talk to him. **Notable gameplay mechanics:** You could shoot enemies but also melee fight them and I CLEARLY remember them dropping green stacks of cash like in GTA when killed and they would also drop their weapons. You could walk around the city streets but I'm not sure if it was open world or just a level. I didn't drive any vehicles of any sort. Aside from the club mentioned earlier I remember a part were two guys in black suits get out of an elevator and you fight them. **Other details:** The memories I have of this game are very vague so I can't say everything I wrote is 100&amp;amp;#37; accurate. I started to think it was indeed a GTA game so I searched for 'gta club cutscene' and found out about the Malibu Club from Vice City that seems similar to what I've described but that wasn't it.	games	Mette	1	1	1	0	1	1	NA	NA	1	NA	1	0	0	0	0	NA	0	1	0	0	0	0	1	0	0	1	0	0	0	0	0	0	1	0	NA	0	0	0	1	0	0	0	1	0	0	1	0	1	1	0	1	0	0	0	0	0	0	0
8qf0xo	[Windows][1993] Bio Menace, but not really	So, it's rather odd. I've only now found out that the Game that I so fondly remembered playing when I was a kid seems to not have been Bio Menace, but seemingly a rather elaborate bootleg version of it. It's basically the same assets, with a few differences Notable Differences to Bio Menace are -No Red Diamonds that you can pick up, no actual keys either to my knowledge -The Game itself lacked background music and was a lot more serious in tone, you'd see a woman get eaten by a monster as you progress forward in the beginning -The Enemies themselves all had a different, less cartoony look to them -Apparently the Original was an Episodic Game, which was not the case in the version that I played -A lot of visual changes, the Sewer Water in a sewer for example was green in the version that I played, not blue -And the Levels themselves, while thematically the same overall, had a completely different layout It's probably a long shot to expect you guys to identify something as vague as that, but who knows. Maybe someone else played it too. Thank you for your time.	games	Toine	1	1	0	0	1	1	NA	NA	0	NA	1	1	1	0	0	NA	0	1	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	1	0	1	1	0	0	1	0	0	NA	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	1	0	0	1	0	0	1	0	1	0	0	0	0	0	0	0

8oxh9i	[PS1] [Late 90's] Dnd Style Fantasy RPG	When I was younger, and we just moved into some new apartment, my upstairs neighbor gave me a PS1 game he had. It was immediately different cus rather than being in a normal CD case, it was in some sort of black, rectangular box that was way too tall for just the single disc it strored, but this box seemed to have the right art to the game inside it. From what I can remember of the actual game is that it was a top\-down European Fantasy RPG. I think it was more of an RTS than turn based, and had Zelda\-like screen tracking from one area to the next. I'd say you can rule out any JRPG, since this was definitely more of a DnD\-esque adventure.	games	Vivien	1	0	0	0	0	1	NA	NA	0	NA	0	0	0	0	0	NA	0	1	0	0	0	0	1	0	0	1	0	1	0	1	0	0	1	0	NA	0	0	0	1	0	0	0	1	0	0	1	0	0	1	0	0	0	1	0	0	0	0	0

If you shoot their leg, it falls and starts crawling in your direction; If you shoot their arm and drops the weapon, it starts running into you. There are also giant robots bosses, and the destructible part was a crucial gameplay part. (https://youtu.be/ZhzACZm3q9g?t=2m17s) There are a lot of games nowadays with realistic graphics, but arcade gameplay (like *Mafia III*). I'm not a sadistic, but if I have the skill to shoot their head, it should be fatal and feel rewarding, not frustrating. ####Examples: * *GTA IV* and *GTA V* also has some realism and I like it a lot. * *Resident Evil IV*, had a weak spot system, which was very satisfying shooting into. * *Battefield: Bad Company 2* has a really cool destructible environment. If you guys now any game with a satisfying realistic gameplay, please tell me! I have preference for recent games with action. *Arma*, for example, is boring to me.	games	Mette	1	0	0	0	1	0	NA	NA	0	NA	0	0	0	0	0	NA	0	1	0	0	0	0	1	0	0	1	0	1	0	0	0	0	1	0	NA	1	0	0	0	0	0	0	1	0	1	0	0	1	1	0	1	0	0	1	1	0	0	0
8o35v0	iMac G3 game/drawing program that helped you build a create-your-own-adventure style game	Does anyone else remember this game/paint or drawing program? It was on an iMac G3 desktop at my middle school. It looked pretty basic, kind of like Apple Paint, fewer icons than KidPix as far as I can remember, but it allowed you to turn things you had drawn into buttons which would lead to other screens, and there was a sidebar that looked almost like Keynote or PowerPoint, showing each page you'd created and which other pages it was attached to. I remember one summer a bunch of us made these elaborate adventures, clicking through castles and stuff, and then we'd go get other kids to come play them. Been searching for this for a while! Hope someone will come through.	games	Vivien	1	0	0	0	1	1	NA	NA	0	NA	0	0	0	0	0	NA	0	1	0	0	0	0	1	0	0	1	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	NA	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	1	0	0	1	0	0	1	0	0	0	1	0	0	0	0	0
8pwknd	2D MMO - Asian Style Game with Classes	**Platform(s): Windows** **Genre: 2D MMO** **Estimated year of release: 2000\~ (in 2008 it had many people playing with me.)** **Graphics/art style: 2D bright colors, similar to Ragnarok online** **Notable characters: Characters had same body, male and female slight differences, you could customize hair. Some monk class had orange goku\-like outfit. Summoner had white outfit I think. Gladiator had big orange armor?** **Notable gameplay mechanics: Monsters moved tile by tile in real time, kind of hopping across. When you killed mobs they dropped loot in that tile all in one. I think the game had a first class, like mage, then went to summoner.** **Other details: Entry area was a grey tile castle type of dungeon. There were rats and other critter type mobs. Once you leveled there for a bit you could go to a forest type area and kill praying mantis mobs for tons of exp. I feel like the title screen for the game had an orange circular symbol and game title had word online in it.**	games	Maria	1	1	1	0	1	1	NA	NA	0	NA	1	0	0	0	0	NA	0	1	0	0	0	0	1	0	0	1	0	1	0	0	0	0	0	0	NA	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	1	0	0	1	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0

8o6hkz	Interesting online games but with enough downtime to allow conversations on unrelated topics?	A lot of games have the problem that they demand too much attention to be a good social game. You either can't have conversations at all, or the entire conversation becomes about the game itself. I've found PUBG to be an exceptional social game. You have a lot of downtime while looting and running around, and that allows for general conversations to flow. When they are interrupted it's usually something interesting that creates a story. And it's so simple that I can buy a copy for a friend and they can jump in and have a good time right from the beginning without having to learn a bunch of mechanics. But even PUBG is starting to get boring now, and I'm looking for other games that would fit the same role as a social game for me and my friends.	games	Maria	1	0	0	0	1	0	NA	NA	0	NA	0	0	0	0	0	NA	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	1	1	NA	1	0	0	0	1	0	0	1	0	1	0	0	1	0	0	0	0	0	1	1	0	0	0

You played a young girl with blonde hair and I think a red dress. It was a haunted house platformer. The first level I remember you had to go through this grey hallway and haunted knights would come out of the walls. You had no weapons that I remember, you had to aim your cursor to interact with objects as she walked along. The next level you had a grand dining room kinda, and windows would break and paintings fly off the walls to try and hit your character and you had to click on them to help her. And when she died she would just flop on the ground this pile of blonde hair. Anyway if anyone remembers this it would be sooo cool.

8qu50t	[PC] [Early 2000s] Got the disc from a cereal box, game similar to risk / civilization	Got the game between 2000 and 2005. I remember we got the game from a cereal box, General Mills I believe was the cereal manufacturer, they were giving out game demo discs in the cereal boxes for a while. It was during that time. I want to say the name had “realm” in it, and the the land you controlled in the game was called a realm. When you start a game you pick a leader between different dukes, or lords or kings or such, and the computer played others, depending on how many there will be in the game. The game was a top down style map, turn based game. On your turn you take your troops and go to attack the others on the map, or build/increase your realm, somewhat similar to civilization, but it wasn’t any version of civ I’ve seen.	games	Maria	1	1	0	0	1	0	NA	NA	1	NA	0	0	0	0	0	NA	0	1	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	1	0	1	0	0	1	0	0	0	NA	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	1	0	0	1	0	1	1	0	0	0	1	0	0	0	0	0

There was a screen where you could change gear that showed your character whereing just rags on his waist. There were several factions where you got a progress bar showing how friendly you were with that faction. But the more friendly you got with one faction the more the opposing faction hated you.

So I guess it was late 80's or early 90's and it was on tape. It felt like a platform game, all\-side scrolling (surely horizontal scrolling), with what I think was a pretty realistic and modern settings with a dark hint (perhaps it was night). I remeber the character was dressed in black and there was some kind of balaclava covering his face. Maybe a burglar of some sort. If my old memory isn't THIS faulty, I think there was a portrait of the character with almost just his eyes displaying because of said balaclava. At the beginning I remeber a little boat of some sort, pheraps a speedboat, maybe this is the way the character gets to the scene. There were definitely human enemies (cop? I can't remember) but I remeber a dog as well.	games	Vivien	1	1	0	0	1	1	NA	NA	0	NA	1	0	0	0	0	NA	0	1	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	1	0	1	0	0	0	0	0	0	NA	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	1	0	0	1	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0

I can be wrong tho) but 2009-2010 is when I first played it. **Graphics/art style:** 3D, nothing spectacular. **Notable characters:** I'm pretty sure you played as a guy. **Notable gameplay mechanics:** First, the player had to press consecutive two pressure plates in a limited time in order to open the entrance of the pyramid. Once entered you had to cross a bridge while being attacked by a big bird. I remember you could kick it with your foot and fist. **Other details:** Also I remember there was a tribal looking guy who attacked you if you tried to cross his room.

8pbu0y	Killing a monster with barrels.	**Platform(s):** PS4. (Possibly PS3 or Xbox 360, but I do not think so.) **Genre:** Unsure, action, shooting. **Estimated year of release:** Within the last 5. **Graphics/art style:** I want to say fairly realistic. **Notable characters:** Do not remember. **Notable gameplay mechanics:** Possibly a time demo; had to use environment to kill big baddie; had to track the monster, or tracking something else and the monster appeared. **Other details:** I am sure everybody here gets this a lot, but my memory is pretty fuzzy for some reason. There is always a chance I have gotten several games jumbled in my head, but here goes. I believe this game was a demo or beta and that it was timed. I believe you are hunting something through a forest, tracking something. I remember having to crawl through a fallen log. Eventually you get to where the whatever battle is, and the battle was pretty much geared towards needing to shoot environmental hazards (I believe it was explosive barrels) to kill the enemy. I am sorry, but I do not remember if it was third or first person. Thanks in advance, guys.	games	Vivien	1	0	0	0	1	0	NA	NA	0	NA	1	0	0	0	0	NA	0	1	0	1	0	0	1	0	0	1	0	1	0	0	0	0	0	0	NA	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	1	0	0	1	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0

8sfx84	Games with strong self-empowerment?	I've been looking for sandbox(ish), open-world(ish) games where the player is able to empower themselves to super-natural levels, perhaps demi-god like levels of natural power/capability. Whether drinking potions of permanent +1 strength, training and leveling up, or by other magical means, the path to power always seemed like a fun and interesting experience. I tend to favor discrete or continuous bodily attributes rather than skills or traits in the player's progression, but it isn't strictly mandatory. Some games I tried that are like what I'm looking for: ADOM - Searching for potions, wishes and corpses that permanently augment the player's stats and intrinsics is definitely fun and matches what I'm looking for, and I definitely revisit it time to time. It's quite a grind in searching through so many lootpiles to find what you're looking for, though. The coolest part is obtaining age-immortality with potions of youth. I've yet to even reach the mid-game, though. CDDA - Mutations and bionics allows a good experience in self-empowerment as well, but there isn't a lot of player agency beyond just survival and some static NPC quests, and the empowerment seems to have a fairly low limit (and the equipment on yourself seems to matter more in the end of the day.) The end-game is quite the grind in hacking vehicles and finding resources, and many of the desirable bionics cannot be crafted. Dwarf Fortress - It's fun a heck, but it's hard to obtain a good sense of direction in adventure mode, and there's no real way to augment yourself besides becoming a necromancer or vampire. The upper limit of what you can obtain for attributes isn't really high either, and the size of the creature, something that cannot be changed through character development, seems to have a large impact too. Skyrim - Requiem + Dragon Soul Relinquishment + Truly Absorb Dragon Souls + Uncapper allows you to actually feel like you're powerful as heck (eventually) as the world is unleveled, but it's tiring to start yet another new game, visit the same places and do the same quests. Strict house-rules and RP has gotten me a lot farther, but ultimately I'm still worn down quickly. Morrowind - There's no real way to empower yourself besides temporary effects and level-ups, but despite that there's some good stuff here like Skyrim towards how much it matters towards combat, alchemy and persuasion, especially at really high amounts. Sims 3 - Fairly terrible performance, but there's some merit here despite not being able to achieve super-powerful status and abilities besides immortality. Becoming stronger is also reflected in the appearance of the character, too, so that's cool. Thanks for all the help.	games	Marijn	1	0	0	0	1	0	NA	NA	0	NA	0	0	1	0	0	NA	1	1	0	0	0	0	1	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	NA	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	1	0	1	0	0	1	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0
8sljoz	Windows game ~1997	I bought this game back in 1997, it was one of those quasi-realtime strategy games that ran on Windows. The gist of it was you were hired to run a futuristic planet and you had a variety of things to control; mining (where to survey and where to mine), espionage (who to get a dossier on and who to blackmail/bribe), fleet management (what ships to build, where to send them), and a few other things. The 'tutorial' was the character who hired you telling you what to do with a really redneck twist, and at some point you could even spy on and blackmail him, at which point he'd pay up, say 'you stink' and stop giving you help/hints. I know, I know, really vague ...

8obsrq	[PC] [1998] Unknown mod for Quake II	Platform: PC Genre: mod for Quake II Estimated year of release: 1998 Graphics / art style: Sponsored textures and the logos of ID Software and Activision would seem to indicate an official release of some sort, maybe on an expansion disc. The map pictured appears similar to / a Q2 conversion of the Levelord map hipdm1 'The Edge of Oblivion' for the original Quake. Notable characters: Appears to be 2v2 or 1v1, red team and blue team. Notable gameplay mechanics: Appears from the youtube video evidence to be a mod of single flag capture. The single flag respawns on the lower level of the map. The two teams battle to grab it and bring it up to their platform.

8qbpk8	Early CD ROM driving game	PC game from 1993 or so. A demo was released on a magazine CD in the early days of CD becoming a viable standard for PC software Platform: PC Genre: Driving / racing Year of release: Probably between 1991 and 1993 Notable Characters: When you were pulled over you would see FMV of a cop or sherrif giving you a talking too through the window of the car. Gameplay: Much like Test Drive or Need for speed. It didn't have combat. Details: It wasn't a big name from the period like Car &amp;amp; Driver or Ford Sim. It might have been sold with a model car in the packaging. I like to think it was one of the first CD ROM racing games as we had only just got our first CD ROM drive and discs were scarce. I would buy a magazine purely for having a CD on the front as most mags still had 3.5 inch.	games	Maria	1	1	0	0	0	0	NA	NA	0	NA	0	0	0	0	0	NA	0	1	0	1	0	0	1	0	1	1	0	1	0	1	0	0	0	0	NA	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	1	0	0	1	0	1	1	0	1	0	0	0	0	0	0	0
8sozwo	Old Game like Bully and Simpsons Hit n Run	I remember being very young and playing this game on the PS2. The best way I can describe it is that it’s similar to Hit n Run and Bully. It was definitely a kids game that was open world. I’m pretty sure you played as a boy that rode around on a bike in his neighborhood running errands and doing missions. From what I remember one of the missions and locations on the map was a public pool. I don’t remember much more from the game as I’m pretty sure this was somewhere between 2005-2007.

8qo2au	Win 3.11 &amp;gt;1995 WWI planes top down scroller	I'm trying to find a game that I remember playing as a kid. We had this on a 3.5' floppy with several other files on it. The game consisted of a single executable file called 'baron.exe', I think. We always ran the exe right out of a Windows 3.11 folder. We probably got this floppy between '91 and '93. The game was a top down scroller where you flew a simple looking (bi)plane, and faced enemies that were of similar size, and a different colour. I want to say that you flew a green plane, and your enemies were red. Occasionally an enemy plane that was about three times your size would appear on screen. The graphics were very simple, and looked similar to 1942, but simpler. I don't remember clouds, or landforms moving below you. https://www.c64-wiki.com/images/8/80/1942_Animation.gif There may have been powerups after you took out enemies, but I don't remember.	games	Vivien	1	0	0	0	1	1	NA	NA	0	NA	0	0	0	0	0	NA	1	1	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	1	0	1	0	0	0	0	0	0	NA	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	1	0	0	1	0	0	1	1	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0

So, when you ate Leek(?) you had a double-jump from farting, but when you ate a Burger you get fat and can break blocks. **Other details:** I remember playing it on Armor Games, but there was an official microsite for it too. There was a museum for nutrients or something similar, where you could see all of them that you had 'collected'. The first level was a forest, with some platforms in the air you had to double-jump between with the leek. Beneath it was an underground section that you had to access with the burger powerup, and it was grey, with concrete and fast-food ads. They had a clown, but I don't think it was for McDonalds, since the game promotes healthy eating generally.	games	Maria	1	1	0	0	1	1	NA	NA	1	NA	0	0	0	0	0	NA	0	1	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	1	0	1	0	0	0	0	0	0	NA	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	1	0	0	1	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0

8qivqa	Looking for a very old dungeon crawler browsergame that I cannot remember the name of.	I really miss a oldschool game i used to play in highschool. The game was insanely basic. Much like adventure quest but with less detail believe it or not. It generated one turn you could use every 10 minutes or so. Only showed HP bars and name of the monster you were fighting. Sometimes you found a chest instead of a monster on the turn you used. And if you died you had to start all over again from scratch. Killing monsters and looting chests kept you going with healing potions and better gear rewards . as you progressed the fights got harder and harder and there was a leaderboard on the highest levels. The game is atleast 15 years old and runs on your browser I understand that this is vague info. But please if this rings any bell to simularity of a game you know the name of, please tell me the name and i will check if its that game. Thanks in advance if you take the time helping me find my nostalgia!	games	Marijn	1	1	0	0	1	1	NA	NA	0	NA	1	0	0	0	0	NA	0	1	0	0	0	0	1	0	0	1	0	1	0	0	0	0	1	1	NA	0	0	0	0	0	1	1	1	0	0	1	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0

It would have to be a reasonably popular game, I didn't own any obscure stuff. Thanks for any help! This is driving me crazy. It could be as old as 20 years, and I'm feeling like it was from a PC game. I was young then so it was probably targeted at a young audience. It's not a main theme, it seems like it was some menu song or a very common one during slow parts of the game. If it helps, the real one sounded more steel drum-ish and higher pitched that the virtual piano I used to replicate it.	games	Maria	1	0	0	0	0	0	NA	NA	0	NA	0	1	0	0	0	NA	0	1	1	0	0	0	0	0	1	1	0	1	1	0	0	0	0	0	NA	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	1	0	0	1	0	0	1	1	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0

8oyvn5	Looking for multiplayer games that aren't FPS or survival based	The genre as a whole has just become truly tiring to play. I enjoy my fair share of Rainbow Six Siege and Overwatch, but it seems like there are no fun multiplayer games that don't revolve around shooting. An exception to this concept for me is Splatoon, I thought it was really fun and unique. Basically, what I'm looking for is a fun game that isn't a shooter. Something I can genuinely say 'I'm having a blast with this!', and if possible, I would appreciate it to be multiplayer. I have tried Terraria and I liked it, along with ARK, but the concept it a bit tiring as well. Any help is super appreciated!

To ask my fellow redditors what games I should play. I want to be surprised by these games.

I want a game where I have to actually try during battle not just press x and wait. Turn based or action is fine, just need something where I feel like I'm fighting instead of watching. Level up system-wise, I want something with levels and stats etc, but I'm more lenient here than combat. Please recommend something even if it doesn't exactly for what I'm asking for.

I would give Polybridge as an sort of example of graphical style. **Notable characters:** **Notable gameplay mechanics:** There were multiple trucks on the map and the objective was to plot out a path they take through the map to their destination so that they don't crash into each other. So you would pick a route for every truck and then click the ''play'' button and see what happens. **Other details:** Sometimes the trucks would have to pick up something on the map to deliver to a specific house, and they would have different colors, so only a yellow truck can deliver stuff to the yellow house etc.	games	Mette	1	0	0	0	1	1	NA	NA	1	NA	0	0	0	0	0	NA	0	1	0	0	0	0	1	0	0	1	0	1	0	0	0	0	0	0	NA	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	1	0	0	1	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0

8q3tvk	A polished online multiplayer PC game that's immersive with good art style and chill gameplay with tense moments	Most recently, I played **BattleTech**. I haven't tried the multiplayer component of it yet, and I don't feel tension in the singleplayer gameplay. Although, I enjoy its art style and slow pacing. **Guild Wars 2** felt boring to me with it's free questing gameplay and lack of tense moments. I thought its controls and interface felt unpolished, and movement and animations felt unresponsive to me. **Battlefront 2's (2017)** game modes felt like they lack a sense of urgency. However, I enjoyed the interface - it feels satisfying seeing a level up notification. I played a little **Fractured Space**, and I thought it's gameplay had some tense moments when pushing on the opposing team's base or defending. I thought the overall game felt unpolished, and it was hard for me to get immersed into the grind and setting. I did like the art style however. **Conan Exiles** is beautiful. I found it relaxing with just harvesting resources and building a base, but I didn't feel any tense moments in PvP encounters. However, I played on a PvE-Conflict server if that's a factor. **Zelda: BOTW** was a breath of fresh air, but if only there was an online multiplayer component, it would be a daily game for me. It felt like **Star Citizen** to me, but with content and polished performance. **Destiny 2** comes close to what I'm looking for in a game, but I wish it had the open world exploration of BOTW and Star Citizen. I feel like the game's controls, animations, and interface is overall polished. I enjoyed its art style and setting - I felt like I existed in its world. I thought the Heroic Strikes with the recent raised difficulty and Competitive mode PvP felt tense. Iron Banner PvP was too tense for me. **TL;DR**: Looking for an online multiplayer PC game that has Destiny 2's polished controls and tense PVP with Conan Exiles' sandbox, BOTW's sense of wonder, and Star Citizen's sense of player character immersion. I prefer science fiction, science fantasy, and fantasy settings. I'm open to any game genres.	games	Maria	1	0	0	0	1	1	NA	NA	1	NA	0	0	0	0	0	NA	0	1	0	0	0	0	1	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	1	1	NA	1	0	0	0	0	0	0	1	0	1	0	0	1	0	0	0	0	0	1	0	1	0	1

The thing is I still wanna play it, therefore I ask you guys for help. All I remamber form this game is: \-The first level (map) was some kind of factory, the car was old (classic), blue maybe. \-There was a level (a kind of desert), offroad cars and pink checkpoints, which reminds me of these mines from Knights of the Old Republic, but pink. \-I dont know how old this game is, but I played it in 2008-2013. It doesnt mean its not older though. Even if you dont know this game, you could type some ideas, maybe it will help.

8smhbp	Dying to remember	Ok so this has been driving me crazy for years, hopefully someone here can help. I remember playing an old side-scrolling game when I was a kid in which you play as three or four different people in a “party” or whatever you want to call it, one of the characters was a mole person or something with goggles and I think a robot hand or something (sounds nuts I know XD) maybe not a mole person, maybe just short and fat...well either way, short and fat. Lol I don’t remember anything else about him other than him wearing a brown shirt or coat or something. If I remember correctly, his special ability was that he can dig through certain parts of the area, a tomb or something if I remember correctly. One of the other characters was a bigger guy, buff I think, naturally he was the powerhouse that could move heavy things. Another was a shorter character, maybe a kid or something, skinny if I remember right. I don’t remember the other character, but for some reason I keep thinking of Disney when I try to remember. Pretty sure i played it on the gameboy advance, but for some reason it also makes me think of the ps2, but I’m pretty sure it was a handheld game. I think it resembled the hell out of the secret side scrolling level in prince of Persia sands of time, same or similar 3d design and whatnot, same idea. If anyone here can help me out, I’d extremely appreciate it. I know that info is a bit vague, but that’s all I got. Thanks in advance. :D	games	Vivien	1	1	0	0	0	1	NA	NA	0	NA	0	0	0	0	0	NA	0	1	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	1	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	NA	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	1	0	0	1	0	1	0	0	0	0	0	1	0	1	0	0

8p4ffq	[PC Windows][2010-2016] A dueling game where you could control your characters limbs to create unique moves every second.	**Platform(s):** Windows (Could be on Steam) **Genre:** I don't know what it classifies as, maybe fighting, brawling **Estimated year of release:** Really not sure but I think I played it at around 2014 **Graphics/art style:** Really simple graphics, player models are made up with little sphere shaped blocks. There is a floor(like in dojos) Background is empty if I remember correctly **Notable characters:** None. It was multiplayer oriented. **Notable gameplay mechanics:** It was very unique. Every second or so your character would stop. Then you would click the parts of the body you wanted to make a move. For example if i twisted my ankles downwards my character would stand on its fingers(at least for a few seconds :D) **Other details:** It could be played online and there were also custom maps. But by default it was a 1v1 fighting game but you controlled every part of the body before setting your character on motion. I think it had a client seperate from steam but it still could be on steam. Sorry for scarce details. And really sorry for bad grammar.	games	Marijn	1	1	0	0	1	1	NA	NA	0	NA	0	0	0	0	0	NA	0	1	0	1	0	0	1	0	0	1	0	1	0	0	0	0	0	0	NA	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	1	0	0	1	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	1	1	0	1	1
8qh9rv	Games with living ecosystems	I've played a great game called **Rain World** which I really enjoy that is basically a 2D puzzle platformer with an emphasis on non-linear storytelling and exploration. One of the cool features of the game is that the ecosystem is very reactive, not just to you but to itself. So there's actual predator-prey relationships, you can even befriend a predator that might try to kill you if you save it from being killed, and you can often see these creatures interact with each other, crocs fighting over food, a poorly timed jump that leads a poor scavenger to a grisly end, a centipede grabbing hold of a mouse... it feels very organic and alive. So I am curious if any other games have this sort of living ecosystem feel to it where you can not only influence it but just sit back and watch it do it's thing and see how plants and animals interact, how weather affects things, and so on. Not too picky on genre just curious of another other examples?	games	Mette	1	0	0	0	1	0	NA	NA	0	NA	0	0	1	0	0	NA	0	1	0	0	0	0	1	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	1	0	NA	1	0	0	0	0	0	0	1	0	1	0	0	1	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0

8rfapb	[Web/Flash or Possibly PC] 10-20 Year Old Graphic Adventure Where Character's House Gets Destroyed/Damaged in the Beginning	Crosspost from /r/tipofmytongue I have a vague recollection of playing a (possibly web/Flash based) free adventure game many years ago, where I believe it opened with something crashing into the protagonist's house, which I think then led to you going down underground into some kind of a cave or sci-fi sort of environment or something. IIRC the main character was sort of cutesy in a quirky way, but I can't remember if he was a monster, animal, or what. I think his name was in the title (possibly something along the line of 'Bob's Bad Day'), but don't quote me on that. This ring a bell to anyone? For some reason it reminds me of The Neverhood, although I can't recall if it was claymation or not - might just be the tone or style of it. It may have just been a work-in-progress, I seem to recall the game ended with a promise of more to come.	games	Maria	1	1	0	0	0	1	NA	NA	1	NA	0	0	0	0	0	NA	0	1	0	1	0	0	0	0	0	1	0	1	0	0	1	0	0	0	NA	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	1	0	0	1	0	1	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0

Forts is basically a real-time strategy where two players simultaneously build their forts and equip them with various weapons and defences, and the first player to destroy the opponent's reactor (centerpiece of every fort) wins.

This one was a pretty popular game among my friends and I, was an MMO Strategy game (the kind where you build an army over a number of hours and then go capture territory for your alliance) but the cool thing was the army you created was made up of units you got gacha\-style (like FF:BE) and you got tokens for booster packs full of monsters by playing the ARPG portion of the game which was kind of just a gladiatorial pit where monsters spawned. The ARPG had co\-op, too. It was a pretty no\-nonsense art style, the tone was pretty serious overall. Probably had one of those 'man yelling to the right' icons, per the norm.

8p674h	Introduction to Gaming games?	I recently started teaching my mom how to play video games, mostly just because I thought it would be fun to try to do. However, I need some more suggestions for games to help ease her in to various mechanics. I first tried Lego Lord of the Rings, but she had difficulty figuring out how to move in a three-dimensional world, so I thought I'd back down to one of the simplest games I could think of (and had access to), Dr. Mario for the NES, but turns out, it's actually kind of difficult to keep track of what's going on when you can't actually see how the pill rotates and just have to figure it out, and then add to that all the 'blinking lights' that you have to learn to focus through. I've also tried Pokemon LeafGreen which is going well enough, but the amount of information does seem to be overwhelming her a bit. Surprisingly, the most success I've had so far has been with Mario Kart: Super Circuit. It seems it's much easier for her to see both what she's doing wrong and how to fix it than in other games, and of course she's driven before, so the visuals are more familiar which makes it easier for her to know what to focus on. It didn't take her long to at least start placing in the Extra Mushroom Cup (started with that one since the SNES courses are simpler). I do plan on giving Lego LotR another shot, once she's gotten more comfortable with using a controller, and have a couple of other ideas for things to work up towards (FFIX, Skyrim, Civ 5, perhaps an RTS, etc. - I'm *considering* DMC3 just for giggles), but I'm having difficulty filling in the gap of more newbie-friendly games. As illustrated by the Dr. Mario/Mario Kart thing, just having simpler gameplay or mechanics isn't necessarily as important as being easier to grasp and understand. Additionally, I'd like to primarily use games that either can be beaten within 10-20 hours or less, or are fairly open-ended and can just be dropped whenever (Minecraft's on the list - possibly using one of the earlier builds, just for simplicity). Of course, games that have a strong story or are just really artistic are a definite plus, since this is as much trying to sell her on games as a worthwhile medium as it is trying to teach her. Between a couple of my friends and I, I either own or have access to pretty much all systems from the NES to PS2, aside from the Xbox, as well as PC, of course. And obviously, games that have things that could be awkward to be playing through with my mom are no-go's (sorry, Mass Effect... I really want to add a good CRPG, but this has been surprisingly tricky). Oh, and local co-op play is a definite bonus, though obviously not necessary. **TL;DR** Shortish games with intuitive (more importantly than simple) mechanics/controls that I can use to teach my mom the joy of video games.	games	Maria	1	0	0	0	1	0	NA	NA	0	NA	0	0	0	0	0	NA	0	1	1	0	0	0	0	0	0	1	0	0	0	0	0	0	1	1	NA	0	0	0	0	0	1	1	1	0	1	0	0	1	0	0	0	0	0	1	0	1	0	0

I know this sounds boring and unappealing enough that almost no studio would take their time and effort to produce a game like this, but are there any open-world games which focus solely on the exploration aspect, either exploring species, space, different worlds or places, and so on?... e.g. Subnautica in creative mode or NMS without the rather complex survival and building aspect. A game which you can start, learn back, put some music on and explore, after a hard day of work? If it's like Shape of the World, which is a linear game but feels quite Open-World and still focuses on exploring, I'd also love it.	games	Vivien	1	0	0	0	0	0	NA	NA	0	NA	0	0	0	0	1	NA	1	1	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	1	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	NA	0	0	0	0	0	1	1	1	0	1	0	0	1	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0
8oa3h4	[PC]Robinhood game with shooting arrows.	This game was around early 2000s. In the gameplay you had to shoot animals with arrows. I think it was First person.

8qc9hb	Probably choose your own adventure.	A while back I watch a youtuber play this game that seemed to be text based (at least at the start). From what I can remember it started with you and your father going hunting in the woods. I believe there they were then ambushed by slavers or the like. You escape but end up running into their camp and try to free a few of their captives to help you escape. Once they were free they pledge themselves to you and you work together for a number of years. Once you grow of age I believe there was talk about a rebellion or raising an army against this one city. I am sorry if this contained any spoilers or if I am posting this in the wrong place. Thank you for all of your help.	games	Marijn	1	1	0	0	1	1	NA	NA	1	NA	1	0	0	0	0	NA	0	1	0	0	0	0	1	0	0	1	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	NA	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	1	0	0	1	0	0	1	0	0	0	1	0	0	0	0	0
8s9z2a	[PC](1995-2000) Isometric(?) Sci-Fi Action/Adventure Game	I dont remember much except the details in the title, kind of an 'I'll know it when I see it' thing. I remember the art style was reminiscent of Space Ace but it definitely wasn't that because it was more tile-based I think. Took place on some sort of space station or something to that effect, and it wasn't turn-based as far as I remember, so it must have been some sort of action/adventure game. I was no older than 5 when this was out so the details are INCREDIBLY hazy but I will try to answer any other questions people might have.	games	Toine	1	0	0	0	0	1	NA	NA	0	NA	1	0	0	0	0	NA	0	1	0	0	0	0	1	0	0	0	0	1	0	0	0	0	1	0	NA	0	0	0	1	0	0	0	1	0	0	1	0	1	1	0	1	0	1	1	0	0	0	1

8rebs9	[PC][Mid 90s]Horror game set in toy store	I have very vague memories of a game I played as a child. I don't remember any particularly scary parts, but I think my mom/sister may have screened which parts they thought would be too much for me. The game was set in a toy store. You were apparently locked inside and trying to escape. I think the toys were coming to life. **Platform(s):** PC, possibly a DOS game but I don't think it was **Genre:** Horror, fixed perspective third person. **Estimated year of release:** 1993? **Graphics/art style:** Polygonal characters set against still backgrounds. Camera was fixed; you could move around in a scene, and scene would change if you moved into a different area, a la the classic *King's Quest* games **Notable characters:** Main character resembled a garden gnome? Was either a woman or a child, possibly both. It also featured a Jack-in-the-box very early in the game that I think was sentient, maybe the villain **Notable gameplay mechanics:** Honestly can't remember much of anything about the gameplay other than the character being difficult to control because of the camera perspective. I believe it had an inventory system like old point and click adventure games (I don't think this game was P&amp;amp;C to control though) I'm not sure if this was a demo or something because I don't think it was a very big game.	games	Marijn	1	1	0	0	1	1	NA	NA	1	NA	1	0	1	0	0	NA	0	1	0	0	0	0	1	0	0	1	0	1	0	0	0	0	1	1	NA	1	0	0	1	0	0	0	1	0	0	1	0	1	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0

In the actual game there is a huge battle going on, swords and archers, and there are battlements or a castle, not sure which, and then after you fought enough people, a cut scene would play, I think, where some guy made a load of rocks fall down blocking you.

There may have been coins released after a successful monster shot. **Other details:** I think the name of the game was *Gold-something*. I'd have to go into some sort of lab and kill all the monsters. There were various types of monsters, but the most common one was a tall, brown, hunched thing (if you know Gossamer from Looney tunes, that's the shape).

(Even skyscrapers/very tall buildings were fully explorable and destructible). **Notable characters:** None - Strictly multiplayer w/ generic class set (Medic, gunner, rifleman, sniper) **Notable gameplay mechanics:** Fully destructible environments (Red Faction: Guerrilla level of detail), but not necessarily terrain destructible. Had land and air vehicles (like fighters and even \*bombers\*), but not necessarily sea. Unlimited respawning. At least partial gun customization mid game (like changing your sights at base between iron sights and reflex) **Other details:** Game was king-of-the-hill objective based, or CTF based. \~240 player servers (in 2010-2013, mind you, and estimated 5-15 servers at time of playing). Rounds easily passed 30+ minutes. Map scale was below ArmA III level (miles and miles), but just about Battlefield level (such a size to enable the use of vehicles). Game was distributed on a PS3 disc. Games had stationary emplacements like turrets and full artillery cannons. Vehicles had state-based destruction (like most games - normal, smoking, then destroyed). Player health was value based (just a 0-100 value, non-regenerating, must be healed by medic type). Destructibility varied by material (wood was easier, but didn't splinter like in Rainbow 6 Siege, concrete could take more damage, glass existed as well). Bullet penetration was a thing. You could not build in this game. Friendly fire was enabled. 4-5 players per squad, roughly 20 squads on each team. Very little or no advertising done for the title during it's time. I don't think it's real.	games	Marijn	1	1	0	0	1	1	NA	NA	0	NA	1	0	0	0	0	NA	1	1	0	0	0	0	1	0	1	1	0	1	0	0	0	0	1	0	NA	0	0	0	1	0	0	0	1	0	0	1	0	1	1	0	0	1	0	1	1	0	0	1
8ogah8	Easy to learn hard to master game like Furi that isn't Souls clone or bullet hell	That's a long title ;) I believe Furi is my favorite game of recent years. It was very coherent experience with graphics, story and soundtrack created awesome 'feel' but above all gameplay was just fantastic. My 1 walkthrough took me 8 hours and 200+ deaths. Second only 2 hours and 20 deaths. It's just definition of skill based game where you dont have loots or levels you just improve as a player. Do you have any suggestions for single player pc games with similar player skill progression? Important: I dont want souls clones because i played many of them and just burned out I dont want bullet hell games because they almost always base their difficulty on numerous random enemies and projectiles that are nothing like carefully designed non random bullet hell sections of Furi	games	Marijn	1	0	0	0	1	0	NA	NA	0	NA	0	0	0	0	0	NA	0	1	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	1	0	0	0	0	0	0	1	1	NA	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	1	0	1	0	0	1	0	0	0	0	0	1	0	1	0	1

There were diffrent skills you could use, you could choose diffrent color star things before you started. One skill was you could use a star thing that went around in circles around you and picked up treasure in other rooms and the other one I remember was that it would turn you into a maid and un-alert the guards and they'd walk right past you.	games	Mette	1	1	0	0	1	1	NA	NA	1	NA	0	0	0	0	0	NA	0	1	0	0	0	0	1	0	0	1	0	1	0	0	0	0	0	0	NA	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	1	0	0	1	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0

8qdk9d	More games with cop car chasing?	I really like the idea of chasing people on a car with a flashing siren for some reason. I already have Mario Kart 8 Deluxe for the Switch (with the 'Renegade Roundup' mode) and Pixar's Cars for the PS2 (with the 'Sheriff's Hot Pursuit' minigame). In MK8 I tend to get lost and not know what I'm doing, and in Cars PS2 the AI follows a very specific route, which I'm finding hard to follow somehow, and it depends too much on your Boost ability, which is hard to get the hang of. Oh, and in both Cars and MK8 I get a bit disoriented with having to change direction at low/no speed. And in Cars I'm annoyed by how often I bump into things, most of which are not destructible. Yes, MK8 has a special command in Battle mode for changing directions quickly. Actually, changing directions at any speed. You know, imagine you meet the person being chased in the opposite direction they are heading, and then you have to change directions after you get past them. You know? This kind of direction-changing makes me disoriented.	games	Maria	1	0	0	0	1	0	NA	NA	0	NA	0	0	0	0	1	NA	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	1	1	NA	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	1	0	1	0	0	1	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0

The thing I like about these two games as opposed to other ARPGs is their focus on fast gameplay as opposed to min-maxing every encounter and stat. I enjoy just booting up the game and going to kill some enemies, every once in a while going through all the loot you've picked up to equip the best current equipment you have. I picked up Pillars of Eternity 2 a while ago because I heard it compared to Diablo 3 a lot, but found it boring with all the lore and story focus.

We love playing video games together, whether it be split screen, or even just playing single player games with clear checkpoints where we can round robin one controller and all feel like we have a part (think The Wolf Among Us or Detroit Become Human). We just need some suggestions for new games we can play now that we finished our first run through of Detroit in a little under a week (whoops)! Genres of video games we really love include rpg, action, turn-based, fantasy, tower defense, puzzle, mystery... really we enjoy playing any video game genre besides racing or sports games. I really appreciate any suggestion for games that you have loved, especially if you are able to sink a lot of time into the game! TLDR: What are some suggestions for couch co-op games that work for atleast 3 players on PS4? Doesn’t have to be split screen, we are open to taking turns with one controller!

Notable gameplay mechanics: I remember the last boss was in some portal-like area, something like this https://i.ytimg.com/vi/160GmnKOeps/maxresdefault.jpg and that the last stage before the boss was some tower where you climb up so many stairs with enemies coming at you at all times.

8retlt	[PS1][Early 2000s?]Tactical RPG with widely branching story	I'm looking for a tactical fantasy RPG that I played on a PSX emulator in the early- to mid-2000s. It was similar to Final Fantasy Tactics, including the graphics and isometric style, but there were significant story choices you could make early on that directed you into widely different paths. I remember these choices being presented as text, with a world map in the background -- there weren't cutscenes that I recall. The plot concerned a war of some kind. Definitely wasn't Tactics Ogre or Vandal Hearts.	games	Mette	1	0	0	0	1	1	NA	NA	1	NA	0	0	1	0	0	NA	0	1	0	0	0	0	1	0	0	1	0	1	0	0	0	0	0	0	NA	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	1	0	0	1	0	0	1	0	1	0	0	0	0	0	0	0

Among them was someone who looks like a professor, I remember him drinking from a mug and then spitting the drink suddenly (lol i know I am being weird). Anyway, the game starts when the player jumps out of this plane, spaceship, while using a parachute, to land inside a building in which there was that weird fatass monster who's holding something similar to a popsicle? I remember the main character to have a cone\-like head / helmet, and a black custom or armor.	games	Mette	1	1	1	0	0	0	NA	NA	1	NA	0	0	0	0	0	NA	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	NA	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	1	0	0	1	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0
8raqus	Looking for an immersive game that will help me escape from my thoughts.	I'm going through a rough patch in my life and I have anxiety problems. Overthinking doesn't help. I'm looking for a game that will pull me in, has a decent storyline and it shouldn't have mechanics that are hard to handle as I'm a massive noob. I dont like RTS games. I like rpg and fps usually. The games that I played without even giving a break were Torchlight II, Dragon Age Inquisiton, Bioshock and Guild Wars 2. I played all the Borderlands games twice and I love the series. I enjoy indie games like Stardew Valley, Night in the Woods, Bastion and Transistor too. I dont have a PS or an XBox.

8nv59h	[PC][90s] Top Down 'RPG'	I am looking for a top down episodic 'RPG', where you control a gnome or dwarf of some sorts. The gnome speaks, and I actually remember quite a few of his lines: 'I can't operate that', 'I'm a bit scared', 'It's a trap room, I think we should find the map first', 'It's a skull', etc. You basically, navigate through the 'level', solving the various puzzles and riddles, for instance, a skull is demanding to bring him some wine. I've been searching for it everywhere, but I can't seem to 'tie' any 'keywords' to the game, at least not on Google. Also, I remember clearly that the first 'episode' was distributed for 'free', as 'shareware'.	games	Maria	1	1	0	1	1	0	NA	NA	0	NA	0	0	0	0	0	NA	0	1	0	0	0	0	1	0	0	1	0	1	0	0	0	0	0	0	NA	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	1	0	0	1	0	0	1	0	0	1	0	0	0	0	0	0

8otlgu	Old-school game about flying through neon blocks	[PC/Website][2000-2010'ish] Hi there, For a few days now I am trying to remember a small game you (10 years ago) could find on those old gaming websites with little videogames. The game was about an arrow (or perhaps a paper plane) you had to navigate through 2D blue neon blocks, like an early version of Flappy Bird. I remember the background to be a city and the soundtrack to be a mellow-y pop-ish song. The two things I don't remember are the title of the game and the songtitle. If anybody has any suggestion about what either of those might be: amazing, and thanks already for thinking! Cheers.

The game doesn't have to be multiplayer if it has a rich story. I am looking for games that have been released from XXXX-2005.

8pqn3j	Looking for a grindy, singleplayer game! (PC)	I know most people hate grinding, but it's one of the things I weirdly enjoy in games. It could be anything from farming mobs in an MMORPG, running around doing sidequests in an open world, collecting collectibles, mining for resources, or replaying the same mission/dungeon/race over and over again (for a specific reason). I'm looking for a game where I can mindlessly grind, preferably with progression, while the other half of my brain is focused on a podcast, audiobook, or a stream! I would prefer it being a singleplayer game, but I'm open for an online game as long as I can play it solo. A game where the story and gameplay mechanics are easy to get into, but the gameplay is 'endless'! I enjoy Sci-Fi more than Fantasy. I have enjoyed grinding through games like Civ, Minecraft, Black Desert Online, Factorio, The Division. [Here is my most played games on Steam!](https://steamcommunity.com/id/mokkasin/games/?tab=all) Some examples of games I have not dug into are EVE: Online, Elite: Dangerous, Path of Exile, Diablo-series, X-COM 2. If you think I should play these, please tell me why! :) I have enjoyed games like No Man's Sky, Mass Effect: Andromeda, Mafia III, Watch_Dogs and The Division, so please give me suggestions based on the actual game, not the feedback it has received. I primarily play on PC, but I have a Switch too.

8q2x4k	[PC/DOS][&amp;lt;1993] Very simple bug-zapper (non-)game.	**Platform(s):** DOS **Genre:** Glorified manual screensaver? **Estimated year of release:** Before 1993. **Graphics/art style:** Single static background (stylized outdoor scene), with small animated elements **Notable characters:** None. **Notable gameplay mechanics:** Mostly non-interactive. You'd start it from command-line, which _may_ have accepted some options, such as number of bugs on-screen, and the game would play itself until a key was pressed, after which it would give the score obtained (number of bugs zapped) and exit. **Other details:** This thing was hardly a game. When the program started, it would display a static graphic background, which appeared to be a nighttime scene in an empty park, with a single active lamp (something like [this](https://www.featurepics.com/StockImage/20070730/lamp-post-in-the-park-stock-picture-395738.jpg)) Flying insects, composed of just a few pixels each, would appear at the edges of the screen and fly a slow, pseudorandom path to the light, where they would get 'zapped' with a sound (via PC internal speaker). There were no controls except the 'quit' key. The program didn't accept any user input and there was no way to affect anything in the game once it started. (As far as I know.) When the game exited, it would display a message: 'You zapped X nasty bugs!' with X being the number of bugs killed. It was almost a screensaver, except that it wouldn't have actually done a good job at saving screens since the main background was static and would burn-in if left running. It's possible this was something hobby-coded by some anonymous author, in which case it may be impossible to find again. I played it at my uncle's house in the Toronto area in Canada around '93. (I was an easily-amused kid.) I have no idea where he got it - he used to have a big pile of floppy disks with all kinds of random programs on them. Years later, I asked him about some of them and he doesn't remember most. I've been able to track down almost all the ones I remember, but this one is super-obscure.	games	Mette	1	0	1	0	1	1	NA	NA	0	NA	0	1	0	0	0	NA	0	1	0	0	0	0	1	0	0	1	0	1	1	0	0	0	0	0	NA	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	1	0	0	1	0	0	1	0	0	0	1	0	0	0	0	0

Last level I remember was you were outside and had to jump between these floating platforms and one had a glass dome over it that you had to shoot a rocket into the hole in the top to break the glass so you can get onto the platform and I believe it took 2 rockets to break it.

8ohlnh	[PS1][1990's]Some kind of dungeon rpg game...	**Platform(s):** PS1 **Genre:** RPG? Action/Adventure **Estimated year of release:** Definitely late 90's **Graphics/art style:** 3D Rendered world, 2D Sprites, top-down camera view **Notable characters:** A princess, maybe?, villan bent on taking over something, and a hero (the player). Almost like a Zelda game. **Notable gameplay mechanics:** I recall having to collect green orbs (among other important items like currency and potions) throughout the game, solve puzzles and kill enemies along the way. **Other details:** I've never actually gotten very far in the game, but I have some faint memories of the beginning. I recall starting off in some sort of city in a desert. There was a pyramid of sorts at the top of the hub world map. I think you started off with some sort of weapon. Maybe not until you tried to squeeze by a few enemies first. I remember you'd have a helper with you. I think it was a golden owl? Maybe I'm mixing up the details there. Might have been made by Konami, but don't take my word for it.	games	Toine	1	1	0	0	1	1	NA	NA	0	NA	1	0	0	0	0	NA	0	1	0	0	0	0	1	0	0	1	1	1	0	0	0	0	1	0	NA	0	0	0	1	0	0	0	1	0	0	1	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0
8oas44	Games like Horizon Zero Dawn?	So I just finished Uncharted: The Lost Legacy and I'm looking for another game to sink my time into. In terms of what I like, Games such as the Uncharted Series are good (a little short though to be honest?) and The Last of us was fantastic. Although it got a bad rap, I did also like Watch Dogs as well. The open world concept was kind of nice in that I had things to do on the side and in between missions. In terms of my absolute favorite game, Horizon Zero Dawn I easily sunk 120+ Hours into and I still come back to it from time to time. Definitely my favorite video game thus far. So I guess I'm looking for games mostly like HZD, but I'm open to suggestions outside of that style as well! So basically I think I prefer action/adventure style games with a good story and nice combat, and I like single player campaigns. I have a PS4 so I would prefer games I can play on there. Let me know what you guys think! :) I also don't mind game series with multiple games (like Uncharted).	games	Maria	1	0	0	0	0	0	NA	NA	0	NA	0	0	0	0	0	NA	1	1	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	1	0	0	0	0	0	0	1	0	NA	0	0	0	0	1	0	0	1	0	1	0	0	1	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0

Mostly white backgrounds with ladders and platforms. Colorful main character (blue?) and special items like oxygen. Sci-fi theme. **Notable characters:** None really...just a simple main character I think **Notable gameplay mechanics:** You had to get to the exit before your oxygen ran out. Every time you ran or jumped, your oxygen levels would go down. Some (all?) levels had oxygen refills. There were also bounce pads to get you to other parts of the level, and I assume other tools and devices as well. A jetpack maybe? Or maybe that's the oxygen tank I'm remembering. **Other details:** Whenever you jumped, a sound effect of a dude saying 'jump' played. Whenever you got an oxygen pickup, a sound effect of the dude saying 'yeah' played. I remember that being hilarious. I believe the game had the word 'alpha' in the title. This was one of those games where you couldn't go anywhere else, the whole level was in view at launch. I think there were 99 levels, and you could jump to any one of them by just typing it into the level menu bar.	games	Mette	1	0	0	1	1	1	NA	NA	1	NA	0	1	1	0	0	NA	0	1	0	0	0	0	1	0	0	1	0	1	1	0	1	0	1	0	NA	1	0	0	0	0	0	0	1	0	0	1	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0

The main thing was to shoot towards up and destroy everything, and collect a whole bunch of stuff that dropped. It was kind a like a pong, but there was no ball, and the besides the blocks you had much complex buildings, like houses, and a really lots of stuff was on a stage, and lof of things that you had collect after it dropped.

It had I want to say about 6 or 8 playable characters, of which I remember 2, A stereotype Texan that drove a truck and the spare wheel cover had a picture of Texas on it, and a woman in her 20's or 30's with a white convertible. I don't remember how many tracks there were, but I do remember 3 of them, Hollywood, Yellowstone, and maybe Los Vegas, and during the race, the radio would switch music, and in the middle of one song, the host would say he had a caller, the caller would ask if she's on the air, and the host would say she is. I think there were short cinematics for each racer, too, and it was not realistic, some tracks had big jumps or drops, and the bushes were solid as concrete.

They can be ***holes too, they just need to be deep and developed so you actually feel like youre with someone opposed to a robot that just says random sentences when prompted.	games	Marijn	1	1	0	1	1	0	NA	NA	0	NA	0	0	0	0	0	NA	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	1	0	NA	1	0	0	0	0	0	0	1	0	1	0	0	1	0	0	0	0	0	1	0	0	0	1
8sg37r	(3 Games) Girl Wakes Up at Home, in Hospital, on Train	**** CLARIFICATION, THIS IS A SERIES OF THREE GAMES THAT ARE ALL CONNECTED. SAME CHARACTER THROUGHOUT, SAME TIMELINE, SAME UNIVERSE. I believe they all have the same title just with either a [2] or [3] for the succeeding installments.) -Computer / PC game -Horror, point-and-click interactions (lots of jumpscares, scary af) - 3 part series (first game was in her house, second in a hospital, third on a train) - Main character was a young girl (either Asian or white or something, she was pale idk) - Probably made in the early 2000s (I played it in elementary school which was about ~2010 times) - No dialogue This game scared the living hell out of me and my friends when I was younger, back in about 2009 / 2010. It was a series of 3 separate games, which I'll try to describe below. Game One: The House - Wake up in bedroom - Mom and Dad not home at some late hour of the night for some reason - Dead quiet - Freaky scary shit happens in the bathroom - Handprintjumpscare.gif - I think there was some spacebar mashing in order to not get killed - You locked some trunk in your room for some reason or another so you had to go get the key - Also have some VHS or something - Put VHS in VHS player in parent's room - Same creepy bitch from the bathroom comes walkin in - Hide under the bed so you don't get murdered by creepy bitch - More spacebar mashing - Blah Blah Blah eventually get the key - Open the trunk - Get flashlight - The game ends with you (the girl character) walking down the stairs in complete darkness with your flashlight Game Two: The Hospital - Wake up on hospital bed - Ohfuck.jpg - Bloody tools all around you on the tables - GTFO the operation room - Walk around turning on lights and shit - Place is absolutely abandoned except for one thing ... - Creepy bitch is back - Hide behind hospital curtains to avoid being slaughtered - More spacebar mashing if she pulls the curtains back - The door to the basement / exit is locked - Do some fancy convoluted shit to get the key - Creepy bitch is still wanderin the halls at the speed of a turtle - Eventually get out (I never actually finished the game but I had looked up a how-to guide on it when I had played it several years ago, some shit about using soda machines and plants and shit ?!) Game Three: The Train - Wake up on a train - Place is fucking empty again - The seats are all orange - The train is moving but you don't remember where you're going - Train goes into tunnel and outside goes dark I never finished the last two games (the third one I gave up on because I got stuck like a minute in and didn't have the intelligence to look up a walk-through) but I hope that's enough information. I'd love to know if anyone else every played one, two or all three of these games and could tell me what they were called ! Maybe now that I'm older they won't scare me as much. (Lmao probably not)	games	Mette	1	1	0	0	1	0	NA	NA	1	NA	1	0	0	0	0	NA	0	1	0	0	1	0	1	0	0	1	0	1	0	0	1	0	1	0	NA	1	0	0	0	0	0	0	1	0	0	1	0	0	1	0	0	0	1	0	0	0	0	0
8ps51z	super realistic racing game? (pc)	I am currently playing lots of F1 2017 and assetto corsa and forza horizon 3 I'm looking for a game that has really good customisation when modding cars, i love the forza horizon 3 customisation but it is unrealistic especially with the engine conversion. The kind of thing im looking for is for example getting an MX\-5 and putting a k20 in it from a honda s2000 and then putting a turbo charger in it and tinkering with the PSI of the turbo, but if i put too much ill blow the engine. After upgrading my Miata i will be able to hear the vtec from the K20 and the turbo spool, ect.	games	Vivien	1	0	0	0	1	0	NA	NA	0	NA	0	1	0	0	0	NA	1	1	0	0	0	0	1	0	0	0	0	0	1	0	0	0	0	0	NA	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	1	0	1	0	0	1	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0
8puyym	[SNES] Top Down Adventure Game from the mid-90s	Platforms: SNES Estimated Year of Release: mid-90s Genres: Adventure Graphics/Artstyle: Very detailed for the platform and colorful Notable Characters: In the intro before the title screen, there are a man and a woman stranded on a raft. However they get separated and you begin playing as the man. Mechanics: I remember walking around some sort of castle or fortress in a top down perspective looking for items and solving puzzles, although I could not get very far. Additional Details: Even though the game might sound like Super Adventure Island 2, I'm inclined to believe it is not since I don't remeber there being side-scrolling platforming in the game.	games	Marijn	1	1	1	0	1	1	NA	NA	1	NA	1	0	0	0	0	NA	0	1	0	0	0	0	1	0	0	1	0	1	0	0	0	0	1	0	NA	0	0	0	1	0	0	0	1	0	0	1	0	1	1	0	1	0	0	0	0	0	0	0

A camera angle somewhere between topdown and side angle, almost like looking at people walking across a hill** **Notable characters: No specific characters, but had different factions you could choose with different units, like humans, orcs, etc. and standard units like pikemen, swordsmen, and cavalry** **Notable gameplay mechanics: You would pay for units with a refreshing pool of points (mana, gold) or buy them between battles and they would go into cooldown whenever you sent them out, they run directly across the battlefield and fight whatever is in the way, to try and destroy a base on the other side**	games	Mette	1	1	0	0	1	1	NA	NA	0	NA	0	0	0	0	0	NA	0	1	0	0	0	0	1	0	0	1	0	1	0	0	0	0	0	0	NA	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	1	0	0	1	0	0	1	0	0	0	1	1	0	0	0	1
8qmzti	[PC/DOS][199?]Ludo-like racing game	This is a Game i played when i was a kid, but that was quite some time ago so my memory about this game is a bit hazy. **Platform(s):** i am pretty sure it was for DOS/PC **Graphics/art style:** cartoony, bright and colorful **Notable gameplay mechanics:** the game had a top down view of the map with different places were your character could be, that were connected to form the track. it looked similiar to the map view in Super mario 3. It didnt actually have typical racing game gameplay, you moved around the map from point to point by the roll of a die, but i am not sure. There wre different characters with having his own unique car, a bit like wacky races. The cars could turn into a plane over water.

8o9kr3	[Sega Saturn] Fantasy JRPG from magazine preview	**Platform(s):** Sega Saturn **Genre:** Japanese-produced Fantasy RPG (not sure if JRPG) **Estimated year of release:** mid/late in Saturn's release cycle **Graphics/art style:** 3d characters and environment, mostly isometric camera angle **Other details:** This has been bugging me for a while - I remember reading a preview of a fantasy rpg for Saturn in some magazine but I don't know if it actually came out or what it's name was. The only thing I really remember is a screenshot of the main character (some sort of fantasy knight) standing in a town/village on a raised walkway. The palette was very grey/washed out, and the town seemed to have lots of raised walkways that crossed back and forth. It reminded me very much of the Genesis game 'Light Crusader', but if it was done with 90s 3d. From what I can remember it was more 'low' fantasy/medieval rather than high-fantasy particles and magic.	games	Vivien	1	1	0	0	0	1	NA	NA	0	NA	1	0	0	0	0	NA	0	1	0	0	0	0	1	0	0	1	0	1	0	1	0	0	0	0	NA	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	1	0	0	1	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0
8pvlur	Old game about a house burning down and killing chickens	Platform: PC Genre: Top down RPG Year: late 90's Details : So u played as a guy and I remember having to feed animals in it and soon after there's a fire. Unfortunately that's all I can recall , I also remember there were very tough enemies with baraka (mortal kombat) like hands. You could punch everything from what I recall. It is my earliest recollection of a RPG.

8qpj07	Mid 90s children’s game featuring two children and a train	This has been driving me crazy for the past decade and no amount of googling or digging through old game blogs and indexes has helped. Platform(s): windows 95 Genre: children’s, possibly educational Estimated year of release: early to mid-90s Graphics/art style: old 3D graphics, low frame rate, honestly not appealing looking. Notable characters: two siblings, a boy and a girl, on vacation with their family to visit an island on which their their sentient (?) train friend lives. There were other characters around the island they would visit, including a king and queen who lived in a sand castle. Notable gameplay mechanics: As the player you chose where on the island the children visited, and they were taken there by their train friend. I believe it was mostly point-and-click and exploratory, I don’t remember there being much in the way of gameplay. Other details: the most vivid memory I have of the game was the sand castle location, I believe the characters (a king and a queen) said that their home got washed away every day by the surf but they always rebuilt it. There was a stage that had more involved gameplay where the train went underwater and you navigated a sort of maze to recover pearls from mermaids, or with the help of mermaids? I remember being pretty skeptical of the sentient train’s ability to navigate underwater. There was also a stage in which the children visited an aquarium or some kind of museum. I’m pretty certain this was not a game under the Thomas the Tank franchise. Any help would be very appreciated!	games	Marijn	1	1	0	0	1	1	NA	NA	1	NA	1	0	0	0	0	NA	0	1	1	0	1	0	1	0	0	1	0	1	0	0	0	0	0	0	NA	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	1	0	0	1	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0

8nt1pv	Games filled with terrible puns ?	Okay so I've been playing dirty bomb for a while, and also lawbreakers (a long time ago) Both FPS are overall ok, but what made me absolutely love them, is the terrible puns all along. Dirty bomb had the easy 'knife to meat you' line when you stabbed people with phantom, and a few other of that level. Lawbreakers, in the French version, is an absolute goldmine of horribly bad but fun puns that sadly can't be translated. Necrovision had a level on a mountain where you climb to kill nazi officers in a reunion and when you reach the summit with a MG in each hand the dude's first line is 'is this a SUMMIT meeting ?' I just love these dumb puns in games, so any game that has a ton of them, please throw it at me :) FPS games with one liners in that style are great too EDIT: other games that do this and I know of: - Shadow Warrior games - the visceral cleanup games (kinda, not sure anymore) - Serious sam games	games	Maria	1	0	0	1	0	0	NA	NA	0	NA	0	0	0	0	0	NA	0	1	0	0	0	0	1	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	1	0	NA	1	0	0	1	0	0	0	1	1	1	0	0	1	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0

8r1p1m	Looking for an old game similar to dig-dug	2D game that looks, and also you move and dig sands just like dig\-dug. But game play is different. It's a game you dig around, kill spider and red round face enemy with a red orb, or a green spongy tile. Don't know how to beat the level, but you open a gate from a level, and go back and enter. It has multiple stages. * Controls: Up, right, left, right. * Gameplay : Main character is a blond male. You start from top\-left. The sand is yellow, and background color that appears after you dig is black. There are 2 types of enemies. One is a grey spider that moves along the wall, and the other is a round red face that moves in a straight line cardinally. You touch the enemy (when the enemy is right adjacent to you), you die. You kill them by pushing a red orb bombs just like a boulder from dig\-dug. There's also a tile that kills enemy when it touches. It's a green spongy tile with 2 holes. It disappears after enemy dies. The exit is a stone arched gate. Forgot how to open it though. It's a fixed tile. * Graphic/sprite: It is also similar to dig\-dug. All the enemy,player sprites face the screen(you). So spider's sprite is as if you looked at it from above, 4 legs at each side. Not sure but it has 2 eyes. Red round face enemy is just a red circle with 2 pixels of eyes (just like a pig's from minecraft), a nose, and a mouth that it constantly opens and closes. * Levels: There are some distinct things I remember from levels. First level: You start from Top\-left, it is a small room with a spider, 2 exits. Outside, top\-right, there are lots of red bombs. At the bottom, there are lots of spiders in a single dug\-out line, strange for them to be so many as it being the first level. I remember not having to touch it. \-\-\-\-\- It was from a collection that also had bubble\-bobble, dig\-dug. But the collection itself won't help. I've done researches for days, but I couldn't find any. Really appreciated if you know what game I'm having a problem with! Not: Supaplex, Boulder Dash, Digger T.

8p5yqa	Looking for an IOS rpg/strategy game	Platform: iOS mobile game... Genre RPG/strategy... release year: no idea, but I played it about 5 years ago...graphics style: cartoony with poor texturing. Kinda makes me think of crystal chronicles... notable characters: the protagonist Is a human who starts with a sword and I believe a feathered hat. The enemies are monsters. Like goblins and lizard people... gameplay mechanics: you can train soldiers of different types to help you take over castles full of monsters. The battles take place in front of the castle you're trying to take and combat is real time. Once you take a castle, it can be used to train additional troops. A computer controlled enemy will send monsters to try to take back castles you've already conquered and will also attack your primary castle. You can purchase equipment upgrades and healing items... other details: I think it had 'castle' in the name but I searched it and came up empty.	games	Toine	1	1	0	0	1	1	NA	NA	0	NA	1	0	0	0	0	NA	0	1	0	0	0	0	1	0	0	1	0	0	0	0	1	0	0	0	NA	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	1	0	0	1	0	1	1	0	0	0	1	0	0	0	0	0

8r5tco	[NES][90s]Sidescroller with a dog sidekick.	This is driving me INSANE. **Platform(s):** NES **Genre:** Linear motroidvania **Estimated year of release:** 1990s **Graphics/art style:** 8 bit, several landscapes **Notable characters:** You are a fighter with a dog as a sidekick, the dog performs attacks occasionally. The original boss is a giant guy that takes up 1/2 of the screen. You know when you're closer to beating him because his face changes from purple to red or vice-versa. Occasionally, you'll run into a shop keeper as you're working your way across the level to buy new abilities from that you can perform with your dog. **Notable gameplay mechanics:** **Other details:** Early on in the game, you're scaling a mountain to get to the top, fighting enemies along the way. Toward the middle of the game, you were able to fall through false pitfalls that would normally kill you, but they sent you to a secret area. Later on in the game, you end up in a volcano where pretty much everything is on fire.	games	Vivien	1	1	0	0	1	1	NA	NA	0	NA	0	0	0	0	0	NA	0	1	0	0	0	0	1	0	0	1	0	1	0	0	0	0	0	0	NA	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	1	0	0	1	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0

8oh72l	[PC/DOS][~1996] Educational farming sim about hunger in africa	**Platform(s):** PC, DOS **Genre:** Farming simulation **Estimated year of release:** Played around 1996, was probably old at that time **Graphics/art style:** A very basic side/cutaway/schematic view of of your farmland, which seemed to be located on a slope. Black 'nothing' as a background, the rest is represented by text and simple geometric shapes, which were outlined in color, but otherwise black. Similar to the 1st Oregon Trail game, but even uglier. **Notable characters:** You played a poor African farmer, but there are no characters to be seen. **Notable gameplay mechanics:** A farming simulation - you select an area, choose what to do there. Since the farmland was located on a slope, you needed to build terraces before growing anything. I remember millet being a possible crop. The game was turn-based, with one action per field and month. Or per season, not sure. I never managed to beat the game or get even close to it, you are close to bankruptcy/starvation right from the start, and random natural disasters, droughts and such make it even harder. **Other details:** I played the game on the school's library computer (the only accessible computer we had at the time). There was a rumour that the game was intentionally designed to be unbeatable to raise awareness of famines in africa. I _thought_ the title was 'hunger in africa', but I can't find anything of the sort. I came across a game 'food force' when googling, but that one is far too new and pretty.	games	Vivien	1	1	0	0	1	1	NA	NA	0	NA	1	0	0	0	1	NA	0	1	0	0	0	0	1	0	0	1	0	1	0	0	1	0	0	0	NA	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	1	0	0	1	0	0	1	0	1	1	1	0	0	0	0	0
8rh12p	[PC][early 2000's] Top-down rpg browser game	**Platform(s):** PC **Estimated Year:** early 2000's **Genre(s):** RPG, Strategy, Action, Platformer, Puzzle, Roguelike (?), Top-Down PoV, Single-player **Controls:** Keyboard and Mouse **Graphics:** Top-Down was low quality, encounter window was somewhat realistic. Not cartooney. You start in a small village, there is a desert level, jungle level, and facility level. Jungle has quicksand and electric barriers, and facility has white tiled floor. **Notable Characters:** your character (you could look really funky with body parts from several different races), final boss with super overpowered body parts, green tall intelligent race (only race I remember), enemies with cones of vision **Notable Gameplay Mechanics:** You challenge NPC's and trade your arms, legs, torso, and (maybe) head with NPC's with the goal of improving your stats (if you lose they take a part they want, unlimited chances to challenge certain NPC's). Enemies with cones of vision chase you down until you get away or get caught (there's frantic music and their cone flashes red, and the whole screen might flash red as well). Minigame where you toss balls into a goal vs NPC. Minigame where you interact with pterodactyl looking things. Item that you pick up, and then throw to stun opponent for 10s or so. **Other:** I think 'Quest' is part of the game title. Character makes a distinctive 'HUH' when he jumps, and you can air strafe a ton. I think there are areas with low-vision where there's fog of war everywhere except where your enemies' and your cones light up. I'm 20 and must have played this when 6 or 7. After beating the final boss, you take his overpowered body, go back to the starting village, and can basically jump to the moon.	games	Vivien	1	1	0	0	1	1	NA	NA	0	NA	0	1	0	0	0	NA	0	1	0	0	0	0	1	0	0	1	0	1	1	0	1	0	1	0	NA	0	0	0	1	0	0	0	1	0	0	1	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	1	0	1	0	1

Any idea of the title of this film?	movies	Marijn	1	1	NA	0	NA	0	NA	NA	1	NA	0	0	0	0	0	NA	0	1	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	1	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	1	0	0	1	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	NA	NA	NA	NA	NA

The teacher complains she doesn't think the music is appropriate, then video footage (I think from a child's parent's camera) is shown on the stage and reveals the bad kid...with the musician calling the kid out in song.    It ends with one kid's dad's filming everything in hopes of getting funny footage for something like AFV.  He misses something big at the end due to a dead battery.

226398201	1980's movie about an 'september/december' romance??--SOLVED!	I have a clear memory of a movie I watched when I was a teen (I was born in 1971 BTW), so it probably came out in the mid/late 80s.  It was about a woman who falls in love with an older man.  She wasn't a YOUNG woman, maybe she was a divorcee? Maybe she had teenage or even adult kids??  (not too sure about that part)  What I do remember is that there is enough of a difference in their ages (and the man is the older one) that it is a significant issue to her friends or family, like maybe she's in her early 40s and he's in his late 60's?  (In my memory he was even older than that, but I'm thinking I watched this when I was 15 or 16, which means any man who was over 50 probably seemed ANCIENT to me.)  I remember a love scene between them, maybe toward the end of the movie, that at the time kind of shocked me because he was so much older.    Anyway, I don't remember many details of the plot, except that maybe much of the movie took place in a high rise apartment?  I always thought I remembered the main characters being played by Jane Fonda and James Garner...and because I thought it was James Garner, I always thought it was Murphy's Romance.  however, I just watched 5 minutes of that, and I KNOW it isn't Murphy's Romance, because that appears to take place on a horse ranch, and I clearly recall that this movie took place in a city.    I looked through the films starring Jane Fonda and James Garner, and nothing looks right.  I feel like I'd know the movie instantly if I saw the title.  Can you help me remember?  One final odd flash of memory that might or might not be relevant: I feel like either the title of the film or the name of one of the main characters had something to do with a little song or nursery rhyme that appears in the movie at some point.  Am I totally off on that, or does that trigger someone else's memory??  Thanks in advance for any input.  :)	movies	Toine	1	1	NA	0	NA	0	NA	NA	1	NA	1	0	0	1	0	NA	0	1	0	0	0	1	0	0	0	0	0	1	0	0	1	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	1	0	0	1	0	1	0	0	0	0	0	NA	NA	NA	NA	NA
229077301	Comedy: Jew hooks up with neo-nazi	It's a teen comedy. A bunch of guys traveled somewhere and were trying to score with some chicks.  This is what I remember:  1) This guy who is Jewish and a bit of a nerd fells for a hot German girl (I think she was an exchange student). But soon he starts to suspect that she is a Neo-Nazi. She reads ""Mein Kampf"" and even highlights it with a marker. She even showed him a picture of her grandpa from Argentina (an old Hitler with white hair). The two end up having sex and when confronted by his friends the guy responds: ""She is a Nazi and I hate being a Jew. It's perfect!""  2) He injured his arms and had to wear casts. He mistook Viagra for painkillers and then tried to please himself with a vacuum cleaner.  I'm not sure about the second one. It could be a different movie.	movies	Mette	1	1	NA	1	NA	0	NA	NA	1	NA	0	0	0	0	0	NA	0	1	1	0	0	0	1	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	1	0	0	1	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	NA	NA	NA	NA	NA

263010997	Do you know the title of this movie? (90's)	Hi, I watched a movie sometime in the 90's. The movie's main female character was a casting director who's a brunette and got a long hair. There was a hidden camera in her house, and she found it and she flies a kiss to the camera. there is a baby who has a heart symbol in the body and that's a generic, and that's a important hint to resolve a case. There's a stallion. Once a man finds out the price of the stallion's sperm, he regrets he should've got some his sperm on sperm bank. In the climax an old cop appears with a gun and resolve the case. And he complains about his action because he's too old to do that lethal action. Do you know this movie's title? This movie is in my mind sometimes and I don't know what this movie is. And this is killing me.

227932805	Late 60s TV show or movie--Horror SOLVED!	I saw this on TV when I was little (under 9). It was probably something like Night Gallery, but I haven't been able to find the episode, if it was.  The scene begins with a young woman waking up or something. She immediately looks frightened, and there's suspenseful music. She walks slowly through the apartment (or house, I guess, but I thought it was in a high rise). She's wearing a nightgown, white, I think. She comes to an open door where there's a mural painted on the wall. It has a dark background, and a man's figure is painted, all white, no details of clothing, no face. As she nears the painting, obviously terrified, and the music building, the figure slowly comes out of the painting and its face materializes. He is still white from head to toe, but his eyes appear (heavy eye liner) and then his mouth appears, very, very red lips. She runs out, screaming. After that, he opens his eyes and laughs.  My dad was watching this, and I was so scared I ran to the TV and changed the channel. He made me switch it back. (""Don't be such a baby, it's not real"") I believe that someone (or an organization) was trying to drive the woman insane, and by the end, I don't think they were successful.   In 40 years, I have never forgotten the image of the guy coming out of the painting, and I would love to see it again. I'm sure it's not that scary, but I was only around six or seven.	movies	Marijn	1	1	NA	0	NA	0	NA	NA	1	NA	0	1	0	0	0	NA	0	1	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	1	1	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	1	0	0	1	0	0	1	0	0	0	1	NA	NA	NA	NA	NA

Nevertheless, I recall the evil man with his special terrible power. The man was threatening his opponents that he can't be stopped! He walked to the water tap, moistened his hands and juddered them strongly. The water droplets (out of the man's hands) became a small cloud of flies. That cloud of flies traveled to an innocent man in the garden outside the room. Through the window, they all watched how the flies mysteriously made the victim very ill. The victim was choking and dying without any visible reason. Then the evil man pulled back but everyone knew how evil he could be...that is all I could recall. What is the name of the movie ?

Please note that this is NOT ""Alive""! ... these weren't athletes, they were more like tourists.

The Bad guy or girl getting a embarrassing comeuppance from heroine scenes:  1) Bad guy or girl has heroine at gun point. Yet she disarms him/her and knocks him out with one a very few punches.  2) Bad girl or guy starts a fight with the heroine by punching her. Yet one punch from her knocks him/her out cold.  3) Bad girl or guy talks tough and domineering and heroine or good girl knocks him/her out cold with one punch to silence him/her.  4) Powerful bad girl or guy gets punched out in public by good girl.  Can anyone tell me films or TV shows with such scenes?   EDIT: 1) Superman II - Lois punches out the leather clad domineering villainess Ursa much to everyone's surprise. The fact that Ursa is portrayed as very bossy and dressed to kill made it even more awesome that Lois knocked her out with one punch.  2) Diehard I - Holly the lead heroine who is not really an action girl one punch KOs the annoying and arrogant male reporter Richard Thornburg in public. Perfect comeuppance. Especially so as Holly is not really a action girl.  3) The Brady Bunch Movie - The somewhat bad guy Doug is one punch KOed by Noreen in a party. Made embarrassing by him getting knocked out cold in public.  4) Scream I and II - Sidney the shy type heroine punches out the flashy selfish annoying female reporter Gale twice! Both in public. One in Scream I and the other in Scream II.    5) Play it to the Bone - Lolita Davidovich's character one punch KOs Lucy Lui's character. Made perfect by how Lucy Lui's character insults Lolita and is actually the one is wants the fight. Yet one punch from Lolita floors her.  6) The Phantom - Lead Heroine punches Catherine Zeta Jones out cold with just one punch! Makes it better because Catherine the bad girl had the heroine all tied up and was basically taunting her. Always love KOs where the tied up victim ends up knocking out the taunter!	movies	Vivien	1	1	NA	0	NA	0	NA	NA	1	NA	0	0	0	0	0	NA	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	1	0	1	0	0	1	0	0	0	0	0	NA	NA	NA	NA	NA

I remember seeing this within the past 3 years, but not sure if it was an older movie or show playing when I saw it. (I also live in the US and this was in English) I believe this movie/show was a comedy of some kind.   The main character was trying to appeal to someone of status or power, like a CEO or boss, and I believe the character was trying to bring down the competition by starting a rumor that the competitor wore adult diapers. It was then revealed that the CEO-type actually did wear adult diapers and was very angry with the main character, thinking he was trying to mock him.	movies	Marijn	1	1	NA	0	NA	0	NA	NA	1	NA	0	0	0	0	0	NA	0	1	0	0	0	0	1	1	0	0	0	1	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	1	0	0	1	0	0	1	0	0	0	1	NA	NA	NA	NA	NA

227010364	French movie about drama theatre SOLVED	I have recently remembered of a movie i saw in the 90's mid to late 90's in colour and in the french language with english subtitles.  I remember it was about a woman who in a town or city, joins a theatre group, she originally may have been a prostitute or something like that a poor girl.   The movie was a time piece set in a time were i think their were carriages instead of cars. I remember that eventually this woman falls in love with one of the guys that organise the theatre play shows. She eventually becomes a very big hit and all the rich people want to see her act and watch the show.   Eventually after a few time jumps she has kids with the man from the theatre.  She then gets sick, and she can barely act anymore she thinks that the theatre show won't be able to go on, but the girl that does her make up says she has learnt all the womans lines throughout the years and is sure she could pull it off. The woman feels betrayed by the theatre people and i remember her saying a line near the end of the movie once she was replaced by the girl who did her make up or wardrobe. The woman says something along the lines "" To act is to die every night on stage"" something philosophical like that.   anyone recognise this movie? thanks for your help ahead of time.	movies	Maria	1	1	NA	1	NA	0	NA	NA	1	NA	0	0	0	0	0	NA	0	1	0	0	0	0	1	1	0	0	0	1	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	1	0	0	1	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	NA	NA	NA	NA	NA

265532811	[SOLVED] 80s b-movie about a super advanced motocycle.	Hello.  I am looking for the title of a b-movie from the 80s, american or british.  The plot goes like this:  A young man invents a high tech motorbike which can be used as a weapon, but he is murdered by some people who want this bike for themselves. But before he gets killed, he hides his bike and record a message for his sister or girlfriend.  The heroine of the movie is his sister/girlfriend. I think the actress playing her had blonde hair. She goes to the inventor's place where he has hidden the bike and listens to the message he has left for her. He explains the situation and warns her that the same men who killed him will come after her.  I think she has another man with her, her boyfriend or a friend? cant remember.  Anyway, some of the killers attack them in the place where the bike is but the woman activates the bike which protects them from the killers, by shooting them with lasers, I think? Then he rides it with her friend and leaves the place which explodes (I think), and she decides to seek revenge for her brother/boyfriend.   That's all I remember because I saw the movie until that part.  The movie was cheesy and very reminiscent of the 80s, with neon lights everywhere and lots of pop synthesized music, I think a scene takes in an 80s club too.  So, anyone knows the title of the movie? would like to know what happens in the end.	movies	Maria	1	1	NA	0	NA	1	NA	NA	1	NA	0	1	0	0	0	NA	0	1	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	1	0	1	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	1	0	0	1	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	NA	NA	NA	NA	NA
263816385	hanging onto hook on a crane SOLVED	Anyone able to identify this from a final scene? It's probably from the mid-to-late seventies movie (I would have seen it on TV in the early eighties) - for a long time I've mistakenly remembered it as being The China Syndrome, but I've just discovered that I've been wrong all this time.   The final scene of the movie I'm looking for is set in the interior of something like a power plant - there's an overhead crane with a large hook at the end, and some impending disaster as the hook moves towards something like a reactor. One of the main characters leaps and grabs hold of the hook in a final act of desperation, which was also an act of both bravery (because he could have turned and run) and futility, because there was no way that a guy hanging off the hook suspended mid-air was going to do anything to stop the hook smashing into the reactor. As it turns out, the others manage to stop the crane in the nick of time, and everyone breathes a sigh of relief as disaster is averted.  I'm pretty sure the scene I remember would have come from something that was reasonably well-known back in its day, but I can't place it. Any clues?	movies	Toine	1	0	NA	0	NA	0	NA	NA	1	NA	1	0	0	0	0	NA	0	1	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	1	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	1	0	0	1	0	1	1	0	0	0	1	NA	NA	NA	NA	NA

262708231	Creepy Horror film sometime between 2000 and 2010?	OK.  I saw this bad but effectively scary (for me anyway) horror movie one October a few years ago as it kept airing on a cable channel I don't remember.  A bunch of people are in a movie theater they can't escape.  At the same time a man, who I think is a doctor or college professor (?), and who murdered some time before this, comes back many years later to murder again.  He is sitting in a small room in the same building running a black and white film.  The film shows each person currently in the theater getting murdered, one at a time. As he watches this film, his face goes through a creepy transition - a shuddering effect with frightening horror sound effects.  Each person in the movie theater watches their own murder, one at a time.  The only other thing I remember is the part where the man drags each person through a hallway and a door to somewhere.  I hope this is enough information for someone to help me try to identify this movie.

262664499	CANT FIND ANY REFERENCE TO THIS HORROR MOVIE!! HELP!	So this movie I saw back in the late 90s maybe early 2000s, it was playing on TV and I've struggled many years now and cant find anything about it anywhere!  So the parts I remember was that some kids or high school teenagers went on a trip and their bus broke down or crashed or something and they had to camp in the forest, and they start telling ghost stories and the stories were like short films inside the movie, kinda like ""are you afraid of the dark?"" but not quite. One of the stories that stuck with me forever went like this...   Some guy in the middle of the night in the rain was travelling or something and went to a house near the road to ask if he could stay the night or something like that, and a beautiful girl opens the door, she was wearing a locket with a ribbon around her neck, she couldn't speak a word, she seemed to be mute, and she seemed worried that the guy was there, but she let him stay the night anyway, then the ghost of the girls father would haunt them with an ax (I think) and call the guy out like he recognized him. At the end of the story they run away from her father's ghost, they're sitting down but then she takes the ribbon with the locked off her neck and gives it to the guy, when he opens it there's an old picture of him in one side and an old picture of her on the other, then she finally speaks and says ""I love you"" and her head falls off. yeah. that stuck with me pretty well.   So that's one story in the movie, but the kids tell more I don't really remember, but there was also a twist with them because they were all dead and they didnt know,I guess the bus did crash or something.  I hope some one can help me with this one, I know it will be hard because none of my friends say they remember a movie like that but are intrigued because the plot seems interesting.  I have found similar stories about a girl wearing a green or red ribbon and at the end her head falls off, but nothing about the movie, and almost every October i find myself looking and researching the web for it, should I hire a professional? please HELP!	movies	Maria	1	1	NA	1	NA	0	NA	NA	1	NA	0	0	0	0	0	NA	0	1	0	0	0	0	1	0	0	0	0	1	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	1	0	0	1	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	NA	NA	NA	NA	NA

225743367	Good guy leaves android love interest on hologram beach	Asked by someone in another place, so I don't have other information  Looking for a movie. I saw it a long time ago and it reminded me of Blade Runner but I can't remember what it was. the big finale had the good guy leaving the female lead at a ship port (she was an android) in a kind of hologram bubble showing her a pristine Carribean beach while he went off to fight the big climactic battle. Don't remember how the fight turned out but I remember that she de-activated while she was in the hologram bubble. It's been a while so I don't know if that's how it actually goes or if it's a faulty memory of what I am trying to remember. Really want to hunt this movie down and compare it to Blade Runner.

The story takes place in an older era (the 20s? the 40s? later? dunno)...  I don't remember much of the movie except the following, very characteristic scene: a man and a woman are having a conversation in a house. Then, the woman lifts her leg, lifts her skirt a bit, puts her butt in a washbasin and starts peeing in front of the man (we don't get to see any nude details). The man approaches and puts his hand bellow her skirt, apparently touching her vagina. The peeing stops and then he says something like ""Do men do this kind of stuff where you come from?"" (I can be very wrong about this quote, though).  Does it ring any bell? Id like to find which movie it is.	movies	Vivien	1	0	NA	1	NA	0	NA	NA	1	NA	0	0	0	1	0	NA	0	1	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	1	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	1	0	0	1	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	NA	NA	NA	NA	NA
226537448	I need to find a film I saw 15 to 20 years ago	The thing happens in America. There was a rather old black man wrongly accused of murdering a little white girl - like 12 maybe. It was happening at a time when the ku klux clan was active.  I think the man found a girl and people thought he killed her. The whole film is about a trial of that man.   I vaguely remember that there was something with an umbrella or an elevator - or both- that was found at a crime scene and because of this they accused him - or maybe thanks to this they proved his innocence? Not sure, it was long time ago.  People wanted to kill the man and the trial wasn't easy. There must have been a young white advocate, maybe also a woman - not sure, and at the end they managed to prove the accused was innocent.  Would anyone know what film it was?  I may be wrong but I think the man was innocent and didn't kill her. I think it was a white man who killed that girl.	movies	Marijn	1	1	NA	0	NA	0	NA	NA	1	NA	1	0	0	1	0	NA	0	1	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	1	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	1	0	0	1	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	NA	NA	NA	NA	NA

264954892	80s cartoon movie about humanoid dinosaurs living in a parallel Earth.	Hello.  I am looking for the title of a movie from the 80s, american or european.  The protagonist was a kid who wakes up, has breakfast with his parents, there is also a dog which he feeds under the table and then goes to his room to play with his toys. He has a dinosaur toy and when he assembles it, something happens and finds himself transported in a parallel Earth, where dinosaurs live as humans.  He is still in the same house, but the room is different and there is a dinosaur humanoid kid at his age playing with his toy which looks like a human. The kid decides to help him. The dinosaur kid goes to eat in the dinning room with his parents and hides the human kid under the table and feeds him, I think. Then later, he introduces him to the other dinosaur friends who are willing to help him return to his home. heir world is a replica of the human world but with dinosaurs instead.  I think there is a villain, maybe the government of the dinosaurs, who finds about the human kid and is hunting him down. The company of kids find a scientist who explains what happened: there are two parallel Earths, one with dinos and the other with humans which came close to each other. At that exact time, both the dino kid and the human kid were assembling their toy and that triggered the teleportation. The two planets are about to have a new conjunction, so in order for the kid to return to his planet, he needs to go back to the room of his dino friend and do the same thing with his toy.  Eventually, that's what happens and the kid manages to return to his home in his own planet.  Anyone knows the title of the movie I am talking about? probably a tv film, I dont think it had a theatrical run.	movies	Mette	1	1	NA	0	NA	0	NA	NA	1	NA	1	0	0	0	1	NA	0	1	0	0	0	0	1	0	0	1	0	1	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	1	0	0	1	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	NA	NA	NA	NA	NA

226562166	Forgotten movie title, help!	Trying to remember title of movie, watched around a year ago on lovefilm. It's a fairly strange guys comedy.  Its about 2 men discovering either a arcade/gyspy type machine that teleports them into a world full of female models etc, the opening scene features them getting chased and put into jail by two female officers, they then spend the rest of the time trying to escape from the place and get back into the real world, this is about all I can remember of it, if anyone can identify it please reply!	movies	Maria	1	0	NA	0	NA	0	NA	NA	1	NA	0	0	0	0	0	NA	0	1	0	0	0	0	1	0	0	0	0	1	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	1	0	0	1	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	NA	NA	NA	NA	NA

226362459	SOLVED. 90's or early 2000's thriller/suspense movie	Hello all, I am hoping someone here can help me remember the title of a movie that I watched back in the late 90's or early 2000's.  I may have asked this here before and gotten the answer but I seemed to have note written it down or e-mailed it to myself so I apologize in advance if that is the case.  Either way though I would really like to know which movie this is.  Also I apologize in advance for the length of the post but I wanted to give as many details as I can remember to hopefully make it easier for someone to ID this movie. Okay, enough pre-lim this is what I remember of the film:  Pretty sure I watched it in the late 90's, late at night on a cable station.  Perhaps Cinemax or Showtime but I cannot say for certain which station.  I know it had to be the late 90's and I am pretty sure it was late at night because it had the feel of one of those ""almost"" a soft core movie feels to it.  It starts off in a doctor's office.  There is a woman getting examined there but you know something is not right because the lighting is kinda dark and ""spooky"" and also the music as I recall is a bit ominous/suspenseful.  Anyway, the male doctor molests/rapes the woman and then I believe kills her because she ""wakes up"" as he is doing it.  The scene then shifts to the woman's sister, who might be a cop or more likely a reporter.  The sister then decides to go undercover and find out what is happening at this clinic because she does not feel her sister's death was an accident, etc.    The whole clinic has this weird cult like vibe to it and the lighting as I recall really helps portray this feeling of tension.  There might be one of those ""experimental"" treatment angles going on with the clinic too which is why the regular cops don't want to get involved.  I feel like the doctor either drugged or hypnotized the victims so they would not wake up or remember what happened to them.     Somehow or another there is also a man involved in investigating the clinic.  I cannot remember if he is the dead woman or the sister's boyfriend or just a cop but I know he gets involved and helps the sister get out and expose the doctor and his nurse (who I think is his wife or something who helps him molest these woman who come into the clinic).  The man also ends up falling in love with the sister as I recall as well (shocking I know).    There was just this over all kinda creepy vibe to the movie with this underlying sexual tension that makes it stick in my mind.  Any help at all would be greatly appreciated.

226871528	needs to find out who's poisoned him- SOLVED	So this one might be trickier because it's not actually a movie I've seen. My Dad was talking about it, but he didn't know the title. So even if someone knows it, I won't necessarily have a burst of recognition, because I haven't seen it in the first place. Here's a summary of my Dad's description:  This writing student wrote his first novel. He's feeling sick and goes to the doctor. The doctor says he's been poisoned and has 24 hours to live. It turns out his professor poisoned him because he read the book and wanted to plagirize it as his own.

265290191	[Solved] Two elderly men give boy 'inspiring' life speech (90s/00s)	A few years ago I read online of this movie that featured two elderly men and a young boy (maybe aged 7, 8, or 10). The boy asked something along the lines of 'is it worth trying to be a good person in life?'. The men replied with an inspiring ""of course"" speech--maybe a paragraph long.   If I read a quote of the speech again I'd probably recognize it. The year could be from late '90s to 2000s. It's a Hollywood movie. For some reason I had No Country for Old Men (2007) in my head connected to it ...which doesn't seem to match, so maybe the film is close to that in release year or something.  Not much to go on I know. I never saw the film so beyond that I can't offer any more details.	movies	Mette	1	1	NA	1	NA	0	NA	NA	1	NA	0	0	0	0	0	NA	0	1	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	1	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	1	0	0	1	0	1	0	0	0	0	0	NA	NA	NA	NA	NA

265410716	Unknown Movie (SOLVED-The Night of the Vicious Valentine)	I saw it on the METV network on Jan. 22nd. It was old but made in color and seemed to be a sci-fi/romance film that might have been produced in the 60s (just a rough guess). The main actor was a handsome male with dark hair and eyes. He was wearing a suit. The antagonist was a female with red hair who wore a bright pink dress. The male called her a ""murderous matchmaker"". She had him trapped in a chair in what looked like her bedroom. She went over to a large machine that printed out a piece of red paper with a design cut into it and the paper was supposed to tell what the man's personality was like and what kind of a woman he would match up with. The matchmaker lady said he probably wouldn't be able to find a woman that matched his personality. Her servant girl comes in the room and the matchmaker woman tells the man that the servant girl is a common thief. The matchmaker woman leaves when another man in a suit comes to the door. The main character man is still in restrained in the chair and he starts talking to the servant girl. He asks if the matchmaker woman holds all of her servant girls hostage with black mail and she says yes.   Another scene I saw had an old man getting his jacket looked at by a male tailor and the tailor freaks out because one of the sleeves is a quarter of an inch too long. The old man insists it is fine but the tailor refuses to let him walk in the wedding with a sleeve that is too long. The matchmaker lady comes in with a blonde servant girl, both are wearing fancy dresses one is bright pink and the other is green. The tailor rips the sleeve off the jacket and the old man leaves. The matchmaker talks to the tailor for a little bit and pulls a fake beard off of the tailor while the blonde servant girl pulls a small hand gun on him.   Later, I saw a scene with the main man character and another man I hadn't seen strapped to a large spinning wheel in a dark room with flashing colorful lights while a couple was getting married some where else in the same room.   I was busy so I could only catch bits and pieces of the movie but somehow never managed to pick up on a title or any names of the characters. I checked the METV website to see if the schedule from the 22nd was still posted but it was gone :(  Would really appreciate some help figuring this out!

I saw it about 4 years ago on pay TV in Australia and for the life of me can't find it anywhere.  I'm not sure how the people are invited or find out about this house (maybe they watch a video that invites them to stay).  But, I remember...  The people in the house watch a video tape of somebody informing them there is something in a safe for the guests if they can survive the time in the house.  The safe has a timer when it will/can be opened.   If anybody leaves the house the timer resets and they have to start all over again  Throughout the movie a male person dies of natural causes and they end up storing him in a freezer chest.   Dark humour.  Can't quite remember what leads to it at the end, but somebody ends up leaving for some reason and the safe-opening timer resets.. and leaves you ""ARGHH!! OMG nooo"" because it felt like quite a long movie.  Hopefully somebody can help me out :) Have been trying to find out what it was for about 6 months on and off now!

264167955	3 movies??	Hi, everyone. So I watched 3 movies and I don't know the titles of any of them. Help me.  The first one is about a very young guy who gets a fake name and gets employed in a big business company. He's enjoying his life, he even has a secretary, he's sometimes unresponsible etc. He has an 'aunt' that often seduces him, and he falls in love with a woman who works at that firm as well. Eventually, his business ideas prove to be really good.  The second one is about a guy, living in a rural place (there are old school salons and cowboys). He falls in love with a girl, who already has a boyfriend. They take a liking for each other, and if I recall correctly, they get in a car crash, and the girl ends up in the hospital. Eventually, at the end of the film, while driving, the guy finds the girl and they ride off together. Also, the guy doesn't have a father and he writes letters to him, that his girl reads.  And the third movie is about a married couple with children who have another married couple as neighbors. Only their neighbors are really perverse and crazy. There was a kids' birthday celebration, and the wife of the neighbor dressed really obscene. The two couples eventually partake in swinging, but our original couple realizes their neighbors are a problem and dislike them, especially the wife. They eventually crash a car, and the first couple walks off, the crazy wife dies and her husband is stuck there.

263325616	Chinese Film? Master vs Master plot	Hey guys, am trying to remember the name of a movie I watched last year.  I can only remember two scenes. The first was of a student and his 'good' master fighting the antagonist of the film in his home temple. The second is of the two masters fighting near the end of the film in a fairly open space that is brightly lit, there are corrupt cops present at that fight.  I also think the film has some sort of special technique the the 'good' master knows.

One scene involved a car driving at night on a curvy road. Some criminals had put a mirror across the road so that cars would mistakenly believe they were about to have a head-on collision and they would drive off into a ravine. But one young man was brave enough to drive thru the mirror.  Another scene involved a young girl this man loved who had an allergy to the sun and had been raised to sleep in the day and live her life after dark.   This you man solved both the mystery of the road crashes and of the secret of this girl's life.  Has anyone ever heard of or seen this movie?

265305005	romance movies	So, I don't typically like romances. I refuse to watch the Notebook or A Walk to Remember. Clearly there are people who can love that kind of movie, and I am not that kind of person. I cannot tolerate two naive innocents falling in love. It's blind luck, right? I would rather see something like, two people who wouldn't typically get along falling in love. I would rather see something like the Chosen in the form of a romance. Another issue is they're typically really slow. Why is that? I like Harold and Maude but something more believable where I can actually relate to the character's would be better. So a character driven situation wherein a romance develops despite reasons that would otherwise prevent a relationship between two likable characters.	movies	Vivien	1	0	NA	0	NA	0	NA	NA	0	NA	0	0	1	0	0	NA	0	1	0	0	0	0	1	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	1	0	1	0	0	1	1	0	1	0	0	NA	NA	NA	NA	NA

My memories of it are fading, but I remember it was probably set on a farm.(It could have been a ranch or orchard) It involved a farmer and his three sons. One might have been from a different wife, or the other two might have been step sons. Two sons were very jealous of the other son.  I think the favored son was trying to go to college. The father bought him a sports car (I thought it was a Fiat but I am not sure) It had a mural painted on the side.  The two jealous brothers damaged or destroyed the car and might have injured their brother.  I have tried looking up the movie by going to http://www.imcdb.org/ but have had no luck.

262657115	Bizarre 1980s live-action fairy-tale movie	Long shot here, but let's see if someone knows the answer.  I have a hazy recollection of seeing a movie when I was a young kid back in the mid-late 1980s, though it could have been VERY early 90s as well.   It was not an animated movie, but live-action. Since it was about fairies or something like that, that should narrow it down quite a bit.  It aired on the Disney Channel, but I don't know if it was a Disney movie. I don't think it had a theatrical release, it might have been made-for-TV.   The story was about a few kids from the real world stumbling across fairies or nymphs or like.. I don't recall the specifics, but it was something like that. What was weird to me and the reason this stands out was the bizarre method that was used to turn normal people (or nymphs?) into fairies, some weird toad-like semi-sentient or non-sentient thing. The person being transformed would happily slide down a ramp into its mouth (I think I remember it belching afterwards) and a short time later through the top the newly born fairy (they're adult size) would float out, now no longer bound by gravity.  It was probably a bad movie but I remember being -freaked out- by that scene as kid, since this ... thing was basically eating (and transforming) them, and the person this was happening too seemed super-eager and gleeful as they were going down the slide to what seemed like their doom. It felt a little cult-like to me.  Does any of this weirdness ring a bell?	movies	Vivien	1	1	NA	0	NA	0	NA	NA	1	NA	0	0	0	0	0	NA	0	1	0	0	0	0	1	0	0	0	0	1	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	1	0	0	1	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	NA	NA	NA	NA	NA

265361038	80s/90s european techno thriller about an evil mastermind hacker.	Hello.  I am looking for the title of a techno thriller with the villain being a hacker. It's from the late 80s or 90s, european, I dont think it's british, but from the other countries, perhaps scandinavian or german, it surely is not french or italian. The movie might be a tv production, not a theatrical one.  The main leads are a young woman and a young man who meet and accidentally find themselves dragged into the hacker's nefarious plan. The hacker is a short, middle aged man, with balding frontal brunette hair. What is distinctive about him is that he wears all the time a pair of special headphones which I think he uses as a hacking device to connect and communicate to various networks/machines.  Unfortunately I dont remember much about the film because I only saw the culmination of the 3rd act. The couple face the villain in some building, I think an abandoned factory or something with a lot of machinery in it which the hacker was controlling. The couple manages to defeat the hacker but he escapes from the building.   Later, the movie ends with the couple boarding an airplane, maybe to return to their country, but they see the back of a passenger in one of the front seats wearing the hacker's headphones. They think he is the hacker and they immediately leave the plane. The  camera zooms in the passenger, and we see he is actually a young stranger listening to rock music. The movie ends there.  So anyone knows what is the title of the movie I am looking for?	movies	Vivien	1	1	NA	0	NA	0	NA	NA	0	NA	1	0	0	0	0	NA	0	1	0	0	0	0	1	0	1	0	0	1	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	1	0	0	1	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	NA	NA	NA	NA	NA
265941878	Serious fantasy movies	I'm looking for some fantasy movies like ""Lord of the Rings"" (only maybe on a smaller scale) that have a serious tone. I.e. not some cute little children's movie. I don't mind a little humor here and there, but the overall plot should be treated seriously, with drama and maybe also deaths etc.  When I say fantasy, I mean a world like in ""Lord of the Rings"" or, to use a video game analogy, ""The Legend of Zelda"" or ""Final Fantasy"": A world looking similar to the middle ages or ancient times. A place where magic exists and where they have to fight monsters.  I'm not talking about movies like ""Conan"". This one is more like a fictionalized version of the real world back in the past, only with some magic and supernatural stuff sprikled in here or there. In ""Conan"", the leader of an army might have mystical powers. But you will usually not see that Conan walks through a forest and is suddenly attacked by an army of orcs. ""Lord of the Rings"" or ""Final Fantasy"" on the other hand are their complete own worlds, with different continents than on earth and with monsters, dwarves etc. being a common occurence. Also, please no stuff like ""Narnia"" where the protagonists get into a fantasy world, but where they definitely come from our regular world. The movie's fantasy universe should be self-contained.  From the contents, it should be a story where the hero (or heroes) have to fight evil, just like in the above examples. I.e. a soap opera playing in the Shire would not be what I'm looking for. Neither would be a big bad like in ""The Wizard of Oz"". In that movie, the anatagonist is merely some annoyance that needs to be defeated because it threatens the hero directly. The evil in the movies I'm looking for should be a general threat to the world or at least to the land.	movies	Toine	1	1	NA	0	NA	0	NA	NA	1	NA	1	0	0	1	0	NA	1	1	1	0	0	0	0	1	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	1	0	0	1	0	0	0	0	0	0	1	0	1	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	NA	NA	NA	NA	NA

A young Gypsy was near a service station that caught fire - the owner, another young man, was trying to impress a pretty girl, and in the Marlboro 70s, that meant waving around lighted cigarettes: not wise to do in a service station - and the young Gypsy risked his life to save someone (who I've forgotten.). And he was framed as an arsonist. He was eventually exonerated, though.  I've forgotten the name of the film: I was only a kid when I saw it. I'm wondering if anyone would know of this film, and whether or not there were any others like this made?

200505171	Here are two tough ones, I'm afraid. (One solved, one still unsolved)	1: I made a thread about this one some years ago (some regulars might even still remember it), but despite that I kept bumping it for months, it never really got solved (some suggestions looked promissing, but I was unable to find out for sure), so I think I'll give it another try. Either way, it was a movie (or a TV series) about a boy, who lived in a palace, because his father was a trusted employee of a king. Both the boy and his father wore wigs, so I guess it was the 18th century? I only remember one scene, where the father tells the boy: ""I have two masters: God and the king. But you have three masters: God, the king and me."" I don't know exactly how long ago it was, that I saw this movie (or mini series), but it was several years ago. In fact, I think it must have been in the 1990s.   It's not: * ""Amadeus"" * ""The madness of king George"" * ""Little Lord Fauntleroy"" * ""The prince and the pauper"" * ""Longitudes"" * ""Immortal beloved"" * ""The whipping boy""  It could be (even though I doubt it):  * ""Farinelli"" * ""A clandestine marriage"".   2: I'm also taking the opportunity to search for a song, that must have come out in 2000 or 2001. In the music video, the singer (a blonde girl) sang while standing up in a small boat. I believe the lyrics might have contained the words ""a love without compare"".   It's not: * ""The constant"" by I blame Coco * ""Lovefool"" by the Cardigans  It is:  * ""Every time you need me"" by Fragma  Intelligence and purity.	movies	Marijn	1	1	NA	1	NA	0	NA	NA	1	NA	0	0	0	0	0	NA	0	1	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	1	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	1	0	0	1	0	1	0	0	0	0	0	NA	NA	NA	NA	NA

We often watched old war movies at her house (or anything that had Clint Eastwood in it).  This particular movie that I can't name had a scene where a German Tank convoy was making its way down a treed road at night. Allies had tied a wire across the road and managed to decapitate a Tank Commander that had his upper body outside the upper hatchway of his (presumably) Panzer.  The scene is forever burned in my mind, but I cannot name the movie.	movies	Maria	1	0	NA	0	NA	0	NA	NA	1	NA	1	0	0	0	0	NA	0	1	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	1	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	1	0	0	1	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	NA	NA	NA	NA	NA

Film has three women who conduct a heist - I seem to recall that they are stealing money out of a giant glass globe in the middle of possibly a shopping mall. At one point I seem to remember one of them starting to do a striptease in order to create a distraction.

I think the movie was french (or italian) and its story was set during a popular fashion event in France (or Italy).  It had a big ensemble of famous european actors, fashion designers and models from that era (and a few americans I think), and essentially the movie was exploring in a humorous way the various crazy things that were happening in the european industry of high fashion during that event.

227391166	Movie with Piedone or Piedone-like actor ...	Ok, I saw the movie at cinema between 1980-1989. It is with Piedone or Piedone-like actor. Starts with something like guys in full black leather suits, black caps and black sunglasses guarding some kind of yard, where there is some kind of bar. Then some other guys on airboats (those flat boats with a huge fan in the back) come from the swamps near and destroy the gates of the yard. The fence is chain link type. Then in the bar maybe a fight starts, I don't remember exactly. Maybe lasers were used as weapons or to cut through the fence, also don't remeber exactly.  This action was during the day, the film-look was towards cold. The costumes and the chain and the boats somehow techno-like.  I thought that the name of the movie was something like Blue Beard/Black Beards Ghost but it isn't, as I've searched those movies.  That's all I can remember. I was less than 10 years old at that time, so I don't know how much my mind has filled in/made up the missing information, you know... :)	movies	Vivien	1	0	NA	0	NA	1	NA	NA	1	NA	0	0	0	0	0	NA	0	1	0	0	0	1	0	0	0	0	0	1	0	0	1	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	1	0	0	1	0	0	1	0	1	1	0	NA	NA	NA	NA	NA

My ranking is sure to be very controversial but it goes:   Temple Of Doom Raiders Of The Lost Ark Kingdom Of The Crystal Skull The Last Crusade   Bear in mind I think all four are awesome. I think Raiders is the best in many ways but I find TOD the most entertaining. I find I actually tend to go back and forth on Last Crusade and Crystal Skull a lot. Both are really good but I find I tend to like Crusade the least due to being so much like Raiders with the Nazis back, another biblical MacGuffin, etc. and the comedic moments are on the jarring side, but that said it's still a great movie.

He helps keep them safe, mom had no clue where the piece is until the son shows her it at the cabin.	movies	Mette	1	1	NA	0	NA	0	NA	NA	1	NA	0	0	0	0	0	NA	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	1	0	0	1	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	NA	NA	NA	NA	NA

227700380	2 horror films, possibly from the 80's	Hi all!  A friend told me about two horror films she saw long time ago:  1. Sci-Fi/horror. Saw it in the early nineties when she was 2 y.o. (apparently...) so her memory's very vague about the whole thing. Can be from the 60's, 70's, 80's. She said that it was most probably in colour, but she wasn't entirely sure. The only scene she remembers is human heads with big eyes on robotic legs chasing people. The scene's most probably set in some deserted area.   2. 70's or 80's film, colour. A family of one or two children move into a house in the woods. They repaint the interior, but when they wake up, they notice that the painting in one corner or one spot of the house has faded to black. Turns out that the house is haunted, the spot being most probably the source of the ghost/ghosts. At the end, the family burns down the house.  If you need any more information I can ask her, but I don't know for now if she remembers any more details.

227693731	Classic Japanese animation from from the 70's	I saw an animated Japanese movie in the summer of 1984, and I've been trying to remember what it was.  I was pretty young when I saw it, but what I can remember is:  There's a family; a mom, a couple of daughters.  At some point, they're imprisoned and/or enslaved by some sort of tyrannical overseers.  Forced to build something, carry water around in buckets, etc.  The family is torn apart; one of the sisters runs away, the mom dies.  Later, one of the daughters is collecting water, and loses her water spoon in the lake.  She's worried she'll get in trouble, but the mom's ghost returns the spoon to her.  I remember that there were no sci-fi/action elements to the story.  It was basically just this really depressing family drama that (I believe) took place in the feudal period.	movies	Maria	1	1	NA	0	NA	0	NA	NA	1	NA	0	0	0	0	0	NA	0	1	0	0	0	0	1	1	0	1	0	1	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	1	0	0	1	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	NA	NA	NA	NA	NA

It's a mysterious film involving flashbacks to her husband who has gone off to war (or somewhere), and either he or someone very like him shows up under odd circumstances.    The structure of the movie is non-linear and keeps the viewer guessing as to what is real, what is memory, what happened before and what is happening now.  I'm pretty sure it did not star well-known actors.  I'm also pretty sure it was shot in black & white.  It's a vague description, I know, because my recollection of the film is dim.

255880261	UNRESOLVED Hello, need help finding a movie OR tv show	Hi there, this is going to be very vague but some memory came up yesterday and I would like to know the film or TV show it may be.   Basically, I only caught the ending, this was about 15 years ago now I think so some time ago.   From what I saw, a man, wearing glasses, takes a blonde woman out for dinner.   You can see straight away that she just doesn't want to know this guy, he comes across as irritating.   Anyway, something happens and she drives off in the car.   The man, about to chase after her, trips on a wire set up by the kids, and is sprayed in the face by a water gun.   He gets up and goes into the car and gives chase after this woman.   During the chase, he loses control of the car and crashes into a diner/restaurant.   There are cops in the restaurant and they come out and arrest him, mistaking him for someone else (I think)   He screams at the woman who he was chasing to ""tell them who i am! Tell them who i am""   The woman just smiles and says ""officer i have never seen this man before in my life""   The kids in the back laugh and he is arrested and taken away, I think that was the end of the film.   Anyone have ANY idea what that might have been called?

262537748	Help with the title of an Italian erotic-comedy movie from the eighties	Hello, Im trying to find a movie I watched on TV, on a Latin American channel called MVS Multicinema. In general, I would describe this film as an 80s erotic-comedy movie both set in Italy and spoken in Italian.  What I remember about the plot is that it was about a young woman who was a single mother working as some kind of escort for rich men; and that her daughter was unable to live with her due to the fact that she had to live with these men for some time.  In addition, there is a specific scene I remember, which took place at the beginning of the movie. In this scene, the protagonist asked to stay at her daughters friends house, and the other housewife agreed (because she was living alone or something). As the scene developed, this little girls mother went naked into our protagonists room and tried to have sex with her; however, this offended our main character and caused her to pick her daughter up and leave that house immediately.  I hope someone can help me with this information, even though is not that much.

262473513	Scrub woman!	Back in the 90s my brother and I would watch those Up All Night movies on USA during the summer. One of them, which I believe was in black and white, starred a snobby blonde woman who reminded me of Tippi Hedren and really looked down on the working class. In fact, her true horror was the possibility that she might become a lowly scrub woman who'd have to clean up after people. Every time ""scrub woman"" got repeated, she looked horror-stricken.  I think by the end of the movie she did indeed become a scrub woman. And it might have involved a circus. Or not.

I didn't see this...I only read from a transcript during seventh-grade reading class. The boy breaks his leg (or arm?) during baseball or softball, and is taken to the hospital where he is told about the cancer and that his limb needs to be cut-off.  by sef11-1 (Mon Mar 5 2012 22:30:36)  I responded to this last week, but your query and my response along with all of the other responses seem to have disappeared, so here is my answer again.  I know how it goes to look for something for years.  I remember a TV movie on NBC sometime in the time frame you're looking for, simply title, ""Eric,"" from 1975. It starred Jon Savage and Patricia Neal. It was about an Athletic youth, who finds out he has leukemia, and his refusal to give up. I only saw bits and pieces of the movie when it first aired, so I don't know if he had a limb amputated, but because of the time frame, I thought it might be the correct movie you are looking for.  I was in the ninth grade at the time, because I remember it came on in the time slot of my favorite TV Show at the time, ""The Invisible Man,"" which was only on during the 75-76 season.  I remember reading an article in TV guide or the Weekly Reader type magazine that was published for the higher grades, about the movie. If I remember correctly, the weekly ready type magazine often had a play of some sort in the magazine. It is quite possible it was published by scholastic, like you mentioned in your first query.  Hope this helps.  by Colonel_Steve_Austin (Tue Mar 6 2012 09:25:54)  Yes, I remember your response to the other post...but not what show episode or movie you thought it possibly was. I'm sure 'Eric' is not it as my story was bone cancer and that is leukemia. I've never heard of someone having a limb amputated because of it. But thanks anyway...and I like your last paragraph.  by sef11-1 (Tue Mar 6 2012 21:39:29)  I've thought about this most of the day, and the name of the magazine I was thinking about they used when I was in Junior High School was by Scholastic, and I think it was titled ""Scholastic Scope.""  I saw several vintage collections of ""Scholastic Scope, on Ebay. Maybe one of the covers will jarg your memory.  Just a note, both ""The Weekly Reader"" and ""Scholastic Scope,"" were published by Scholastic.  Hope this helps.  by Colonel_Steve_Austin (Wed Mar 7 2012 01:30:21)  Yes, it does! Thanks!!  by jellybeanchick (Tue Mar 6 2012 22:27:10)  I don't know this one... but I have been thinking about it lately (or possibly a similar movie). I watched it at my grandmother's house sometime in the early to mid 90s, and it was on TV, possibly a made-for-TV movie. After the boy had his arm amputated, he continued to play baseball with one arm, and his shirt sleeves were pinned up where his amputated arm was.  I was pretty young so I didn't understand the movie, and I don't know about whether cancer was involved. At the end there was a boy that got his arm cut off in an industrial machine of some sort; at that time I thought this was some other kid that was somehow inspired by the baseball playing boy but my memory is foggy.  If this is the same movie, I hope the details help. If not, sorry.  by Colonel_Steve_Austin (Wed Mar 7 2012 01:29:15)  If it was made in the 90s then it can't possibly be the same show episode or movie. Plus the arm getting cut-off by an industrial machine certainly did not happen in the story I read in class. But thanks anyway!  ----------------------------------------------------------------------------------  by LI-Mom (Wed May 2 2012 06:28:49)  jellybeanchick, I think the movie you are describing is:  A Winner Never Quits (1986) (TV) imdb.com/title/tt0092221  Two other films/shows that deal with this subject:  The Ted Kennedy Jr. Story (1986) (TV) imdb.com/title/tt0092066  Ted's cancer was discovered when he had trouble playing football, not baseball.  I don't remember too much about this episode but:  ""Highway to Heaven"" A Song for Jason: Part 1 (1985) imdb.com/title/tt0601518  It's on YouTube: youtube.com/watch?v=kVW54YWRzVM  by sef11-1 (Thu Mar 8 2012 06:06:09)  Do you remember if there were other stories in the book or magazine you read this transcript in?  Because when I was in the 8th grade, 1975-1976, I remember our teacher having us read stories in a book, besides our regular reading book. I think it was small paper bound book, and do remember there were several stories in it, but the only one I can remember vividly, was a biography or possibly autobiography, of Sammy Davis, Jr.  I remember him talking about being in a restaurant eating, and having some people, possibly young people snickering and writing something on a piece of paper or possibly a napkin. When they left, he went to the table they had occupied, and unfolded the note, to read with horror, only one word. Ugly. He went on to describe other things, and about the accident that took his eye. His only thought when it happened was, ""Please God, not my eye.""  I'm mentioning this, only because it might be possible your teacher did the same thing, and found other reading materials to supplement your reading book.  No matter what, I hope you find the movie, or possibly the magazine or book you read the transcript in.  by Colonel_Steve_Austin (Sun Mar 11 2012 21:37:08)  I remember an article on prosthetic-limbs which mentioned Jay J. Armes and the then still current show 'The Six Million Dollar Man'. I'm not sure if it's the same issue but since the boy would need a fake leg after his surgery I'm guessing that it is. This would be seventh-grade (the 1976-7 school year). I'm sure we read this in the spring of '77 so sometime from the beginning of March to the middle of June.  by vpurvis (Wed May 16 2012 14:13:25)  I remember this show during the 1970s as well. It was similar to the ABC afterschool special, but I have not seen it on any lists of the shows.  A twelve year old boy hurts his leg sliding into base during a baseball game and an x-ray revels bone cancer. The doctor told them it would have to amputate; since the bone was too close to a nerve (which even at that age I could not understand, at worse his leg would be numb, but still there)  I remember that he had to make a decision of having the operation. He had a horrifying dream of being a one-legged statue that was quite scary to me at the time.  by Colonel_Steve_Austin (Wed May 16 2012 14:24:37)  Thank you! I don't know why it's so hard to find. If it takes too long to find someday I'll just have to contact Scholastic (if they're still around, that is) and ask them. Again I never actually saw this on TV...I just read from a transcript in my seventh-grade English class. But I know it was an episode of some after-school series.  ----------------------------------------------------------------------------------  by LI-Mom (Wed May 16 2012 14:38:09)  Of course, they're still around!

So they are still around, wasn't sure. Like so many other things from my childhood I thought they might not be around anymore. I should have just check to find-out. Even though we had and read from Scholastic in class, I still don't know if they did transcripts from shows, or if what I want is another publication?

It may have been near the end of the movie, and I think there was this older Caucasian gentleman and he was in a hot air balloon, and surrounded by a crowd.

265970727	Woman stalked in hi-rise	Since this board will so be going dark I am going to post some movies I have not been able to track down. I'll do individual posts.   The movie involves a young woman who moves into a new hi-rise apartment. Soon thereafter she starts receiving harassing phone calls from a stalker who can see into her apartment which is on a high floor. She believes it is someone that lives in the hi-rise across from her and is using a telescope. She buys her own telescope and attempts to identity the stalker. She sees an apartment across the way who has a telescope.   She then identifies this person and makes life miserable for him. Calling the police on him, calling his employer, his wife leaves him, etc. In the climax the man jumps to his death from his apartment balcony. Her phone then rings and it is the stalker. The man she identified was innocent.  The movies was made and seen in the 1970s. It might be a Mystery Movie of the week. I thought I identified it when I found John Carpenter's Someone's Watching Me! (1978), which is the right timeframe and plot, however, the ending was different.	movies	Marijn	1	1	NA	0	NA	0	NA	NA	1	NA	1	0	0	0	0	NA	0	1	0	0	1	0	1	0	0	0	0	1	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	1	0	0	1	0	0	1	0	1	0	1	NA	NA	NA	NA	NA

262233791	Exorcist III inspired scene	Hello, I know you guys are super smart so I hope you can help me with this one.  I remember watching a really bad ""horror"" movie one time.  One of those really cheap, cheesy and lame B-movies.  I'm not saying all independent movie are bad, some are quite good but this one totally missed the mark.  Anyway, it was some independent crappy slasher type movie about a psycho killer murdering a bunch of teens as they camp out by a lake.(can we say clich, anyone?)  So one of the early scenes is of a woman who comes home and we see her alone in her apartment.  Cut to a long continuous scene with the view of a long corridor.  The corridor has several doors on either side.  At the end of the corridor, we see the woman as she enters some of the rooms.  No doubt, this scene was inspired by the famous and very creepy hospital corridor scene from Exorcist III.  However, this movie failed to capture that same essence.  So, we see the woman exit one of the rooms and the big bald slasher guy, covered in blood and carrying a machete follows her out.  Cut away....  Does anyone recognize this movie?  No, it was not Exorcist III.  That movie was awesome, this one was just awful.  But for some reason, I kinda want to see it again.  Call it morbid curiosity.  Please, please, please somebody identify it and tell me what it was.	movies	Marijn	1	1	NA	0	NA	1	NA	NA	1	NA	0	0	0	0	0	NA	0	1	0	0	0	0	1	0	0	1	0	0	0	0	0	0	1	0	0	1	1	0	0	0	0	0	1	0	0	1	0	1	1	0	1	0	0	NA	NA	NA	NA	NA

She wasn't sleeping underneath the covers, thus her naked body shown. Keep in mind the scene I'm describing doesn't pan out to be something bad, as her boyfriend and his homies are clearly just chillin' in his room talking, paying the naked woman no mind with absolutely no intentions of a gang bang or anything of that nature. I know it sounds weird, as her boyfriend shouldn't be putting her through the embarrassment of other men seeing her naked while she's sleeping.  On a side note, the woman might be his sister.  I can't recall their relation.  Anyway, she can be heard stretching/making soothing noises of comfort (how good the bed feels, not a wet dream) while sleeping.

262103164	old B&W movie about a piano player who hurts hands in a fistfight	I remember having seen a sad old B&W movie, maybe from the 1940s or 1950s, that centered around a piano player who had to keep his hands in shape to perform but was forced into a fistfight that destroyed his playing skills.  I must have been younger than 10 when I saw it, so I unfortunately don't know much more than this.  It seemed like a memorable story, but it may not have been a big movie.

There is this movie with 3 women, I can't remember the actresses - any that I've looked up I cannot find the movie under there page, so I must have the actresses wrong. One of the 3 is a bit younger, they are in a bar, then in another place, then a hospital or something at one point..  I don't know. What I do remember is that the younger girl tells this story of how she heard pineapple juice makes you taste better, so she had like copious amounts of it for 2 weeks straight, when the guy she's with finally goes down on her turns out he's allergic to pineapple and had a bad reaction. I thought I'd be able to find the movie via Google on that clip alone, seems I cannot.  please help.  Starting to feel as though I made this up.

265852365	American movies that deal with social class ?	Or with social stratification or social unequality ?  I've seen so many American movies, but I can't remember many that deal with these things.  And if they do, they usually present the fairy tale of the  'poor man/woman who made it because the US are such a great equal opportunity country'. The protagonists are usually presented as heroes that overcome the social restrictions. (see f.e. ""Joy"" or ""Hidden Figures"", but these are more about gender & race)  In British cinema the 'social class' has always been a vital subject, from Joseph Losey's ""The Servant"" (1963) http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0057490/,  James Ivory's ""The Remains of the Day"" (1993) http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0107943/?ref_=nv_sr_2 to the work of Alan Clarke, Ken Loach, Stephen Frears and Mike Leigh. But here the protagonists are usually no heroes and mostly fail to change anything.  Where can you see that in American cinema ?  The best examples I could think of are ""Blue Collar"" (1978) by Paul Schrader  and ""Heaven's Gate"" (1980) by Michael Cimino. http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0077248/?ref_=fn_al_tt_1 http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0080855/?ref_=nv_sr_5  Do you know more ?

219815802	[UNSOLVED] British miniseries	NOTE: I have deleted my replies that had the additional information and incorporated them into the original post.  I think this was British but it could have been made elsewhere and I think there was only 2 episodes (however it may possibly have been a one-off). I don't remember the story but I think a boat and its captain were involved. The main characters were a family (father, mother, son) and I think they'd been asked to help put some crooks away.  I remember them meeting said crooks in some sort of rundown town sort of like the town in the game Max Payne 3, and the son had a tape recorder to record the conversation. The thing that stands out about this scene is the fact the tape got the end, and rewound and it could be heard. They told the crooks it was a cassette player (oldschool, one that played music) and they didn't suspect a thing. I'm not 100% sure but I think the father may have been asked to smuggle drugs through and airport at one point (they were in his stomachs connected to a string, I think).  **ADDITIONAL** I'm sure it was broadcast in between 93 and 98 (when I was at high school) but no later than 2001 (I watched it at my previous house and that's the year we moved). The genre should be a drama thriller, mostly drama I think. Also, I believe the scene in the airport has the father exiting the toilet area but not quite reaching the main area (where you check in, etc), and I'm sure he gets arrested at that point but I'm only about 40% sure about that.   **ADDITIONAL** I just possibly remembered more about it, but it might be another one altogether. I remember seeing something about a freighter with black slaves or immigrants (I'm sure they were stowaways). One particular black man was crawling around the airducts and such trying to escape after his friends were either captured or killed after being discovered. I'm sure it was a two-parter, but what I'm not sure about is whether it's part of what I originally posted.   If it is a part, then the crooks I mentioned were probably in the business of smuggling black slaves as well as drugs, or maybe the drugs were just there as an attempt to get the father arrested. The parts of what I've posted so far that I'm 100% positive are part of what I'm after as a whole, is the scene with the tape recorder and the scene with the father. I'm 50% positive on the rest.   The family were definitely Caucasians, and I can't remember any of the stars involved, or who may have written or directed it. It would be great to be able to see this again after all those years since it's initial broadcast.	movies	Mette	1	1	NA	0	NA	0	NA	NA	1	NA	0	0	0	0	0	NA	0	1	0	1	1	0	1	0	0	1	0	1	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	1	0	0	1	1	0	1	0	0	0	1	NA	NA	NA	NA	NA

264378196	80s british scifi about a blonde female alien.	Hello.  I am looking for the title of a scifi movie. It was made in the late 80s/early 90s, it's english spoken but not american, probably british or australian.  What I can remember:  1. the protagonist is a young man. he meets a blonde woman who turns out to be a human looking alien. The woman asks him for his help because she is hunted by someone (other aliens from her planet or the terran government, cant remember).  2.the man takes her to a billiard hall to introduce her to his friends. He tells them what she is but nobody believes him. They ask him why she looks like a human and his answer is that if Man is made after God's image then it's safe to assume that beings from other planets are also made after His image.  3.In order to persuade his friends, the alien woman uses her telekinetic powers and the snooker balls from all the tables start flying in the air. the entire sequence is accompanied with music.  And that's all I can remember, because I didnt manage to finish the movie. I also remember that despite being a small flick, it was well regarded in the movie reviews in the tv magazine.  so anyone knows the title of the film?	movies	Maria	1	1	NA	0	NA	0	NA	NA	1	NA	0	0	0	0	0	NA	0	1	0	0	0	0	1	1	0	0	0	1	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	1	0	0	1	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	NA	NA	NA	NA	NA

It turned out that it housed lots of unemployed people and he tried to help save it. I believe that place was called Eddies but I can't find any film of this name.

265409636	80s Sci-Fi or Horror flick with Prometheus-like scene (SOLVED)	I was discussing old 80s Sci-Fi/Horror films with a friend and we both vaguely remembered a scene from a movie we either saw on VHS or Cable back in the 80s. There's not much to go on in terms of plot, but we both agreed that some kind of space horror movie molded after ""Alien"".   The only scene we remember was an astronaut in an environment that was either on a planet, inside a chamber, or inside a space ship where he encounters a snake or eel-like creature that wraps itself around his hand and starts crushing his bones. The creature then proceeds to go inside his body through his arm and you could see it travel up his arm under the skin. This is all we remember but it both triggered our memories because after seeing Prometheus with the stupid biologist and the geologist goofing around with the snake creature.	movies	Vivien	1	1	NA	0	NA	0	NA	NA	1	NA	0	0	0	0	0	NA	0	1	0	0	0	0	1	0	0	0	0	1	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	1	0	0	1	0	1	1	0	0	0	1	NA	NA	NA	NA	NA

She was showing it to another woman and told her that he was her husband.

264071301	80s or 90s comedy about an ""artist impostor""	Hi  I'm looking for the title of a comedy from, I would guess, sometime between the mid-80s and mid-90s.  It took place in a big US city, and the story was about a young African American who for some reason or another was suddenly considered to be a great underground artist. I'm not sure anymore why, maybe it was just some high-brow art critic that saw something he actually painted, or part of the story might have been that he just went with it when someone mistakenly assumed that he was the creator of somebody else's art. In any case, the story was more or less about how he tried to fake his way through the art world, which he was never a part of and felt very out of place in.  For some reason, I think he also had a pet parrot in his flat, or something ridiculous like that.  It was probably a US production but relatively low budget, might have been a TV movie or even straight-to-video. It was definitely shown on German TV quite a lot.

While there she saw a ghost of a young boy and it triggered a vision of him as a child. After that she starts seeing this ghost and having these visions of the same boy but he is sometimes very small and sometimes older. In the visions, no one knows she's there except for the boy. He is creepy and very mean to the girl. He tells her to go away and he is scary. The girl keeps going to the house to help the older man and he is nice to her. One time the boy screams in the girls face and it triggers a vision of the dad screaming in the young boys face. Finally she puts the pieces together and finds out that the older man is the boys father. The father killed the boy and his mother slowly through poisoning them. The father is now poisoning the girl. I'm pretty sure she lives and the boy's spirit is at rest.    Some of the details are a little fuzzy, but does this sound like a movie you know. It's bugging me like crazy. Thank you.	movies	Vivien	1	1	NA	0	NA	0	NA	NA	1	NA	0	0	0	0	0	NA	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	1	0	0	1	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	NA	NA	NA	NA	NA

225883415	Erotic film, some incest - SOLVED	There's not much to go on here I'm afraid but I'm trying to find the name of an erotic film which i think is about a young (early 20s ish) couple who are very sexually experimental.  At the end of the film they join the girl's brother in a threesome.  There might have been tents involved somewhere (tents set up in the living room?), I think their parents were rich with a big house and may have been away when the incest bit happened. They were privileged kids basically. I think they were British but I might be wrong.   There might have been a bit where he shaves her, but I might be mixing that bit up with another film, and if I am I'd quite like to know what that film is too please!  Many thanks.

228520149	I need help remembering a movie name!	The movie starts with a man delivering a package (I believe across a desert, possibly around Las Vegas.) The delivery is time-dependent and the driver travels incredibly fast with the aid of some GPS/computer unit. I also believe that his car's headlights are turned off.   The part I remember most is when he drives past a sleeping police officer at incredible speed. A radar detector goes off in the unit's car, showing a ridiculously high number, and the officer wakes up, smacks the machine, and goes back to sleep thinking it was a faulty reading.  I don't remember much else, but I feel that this package being delivered is something not-so-important such as a movie or a cigar.

225738877	What is this monster movie?	I've never actually seen this flick, but a long time ago, a friend described to me a late night movie, where it showed a guy who was kinda bald and wearing glasses going down basement stairs. Suddenly the light goes out and the screen is black. Theres a growling noise, and then as the light comes back on, the creature's face jumps into the screen and the guy stumbles back and runs back up. A funny story about this is that my friend actually thought the TV crapped out and he leaned in close and tapped on it, then the monster jumps right in his face and he jumped back and hit his head on the couch.  Anyway, after he told me this, I sketched out a picture of a humanoid creature, kinda fanged like Dracula (I was thinking Bud the Chud in CHUD II). He said that's exactly what it looked like. What the holy heck is this movie?? Long time 15 year mystery.	movies	Maria	1	1	NA	0	NA	0	NA	NA	1	NA	0	0	0	0	0	NA	0	1	0	0	0	0	1	0	0	0	0	1	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	1	0	0	1	0	0	1	0	0	0	1	NA	NA	NA	NA	NA

Every episode featured a new storyline and cast. The episode in particular was about a kid and his two friends. One was a guy. The other was a girl. I can't remember the exact plot. But, at the end one of the friends is hit by a car and the friend (I believe it was the girl) ends up getting a new heart.

226888596	still looking for this horror film I saw on TV	I have asked several times about this scene, but I know someone here knows this. I described one brief scene where this dark-haired woman (who sort of reminded me of the actress Lily Tomlin) was seen cooking in her kitchen, the woman wore a bathrobe/raincoat, I do not think she had any curling irons in her hair. She had a pot of boiling water on her stove. She was famished and searched her almost entirely empty refrigerator only to find a minimal amount of things, one being a big can of pet food (I think dog food). I think she poured some into the pot, and then fed some to her dog/cat only to eat it herself. The pet, and I strongly believe it was a dog rushed into the room (it was small and grayish white if I remember right) and saw her eating its food. She looked back at it with this horrific greenish face while growling. and the pet quickly rushed out of the room from fright, as understandably so. Now, I saw this on TV sometime around 1990-91, but someone here said they saw it sometime in the 80s, and this was all they could remember as well, and it was in color. Most suggest this is a werewolf film, but I am not entirely sure. The woman could have been a witch, or maybe she was demonically possessed, or just had rabies (maybe the pet food was poisoned). It is NOT:  Any of the Howling films Mom My Mom's a Werewolf The Boneyard The Kiss The Sixth Sense Harry and the Hendersons  I doubt it is an episode from Beyond Belief: Fact or Fiction"", but for some strange reason, I remember it being loosely based on a true story. It was not a commercial, maybe but quite possibly not, too strange and long. It had a ""Tales from the Dark Side"" sort of feel, I considered ""the Casavin Curse"", and ""Love Hungry"", but neither is it. I am considering one of the films from ""the Curse"" series, ""Sleepwalkers"", or ""Mutator"", but as I said, I strongly believe it was a dog not a cat. I must also add I heard about this anthology film, where this woman (who turned out to be a witch) killed three-four bicyclists, putting their parts in either a regular pot or a cauldron, forgot the title, unfortunately. Already copied onto the ""horror"" board, but if you have any ideas, please post, thanks.	movies	Vivien	1	0	NA	0	NA	0	NA	NA	1	NA	0	0	0	0	0	NA	0	1	0	0	0	1	1	0	0	0	0	1	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	1	0	0	1	0	0	1	0	1	0	0	NA	NA	NA	NA	NA

264529992	title - 80s foreign film, gruff intellectual and pretty daughter	English speaking foreign movie (meaning not from the U.S....Im thinking Australia or New Zealand, maybe the UK) from the mid 1980s. I remember the movie was about a rather large, older intellectual fella (writer?) and his daughter, who was in her 20s probably, really pretty with Andie-MacDowall-type hair I think. According to the characters in the movie, politically the guy was supposedly really compassionate, an anti-war communist (their words, not mine...Im not a fan of communism myself) but he was crass and hard to get along with. There was a quote in the movie about him and his relations with those close to him - something about his being as gentle as a clydesdale horse taking a dump. I think the movie was about him tying to connect with his friends and daughter despite his demeanor, because he knew he was getting older and I think maybe even had had a heart attack.  I saw this movie at a metro-Detroit art-type theater in the mid 80s, the kind of place that always played foreign films. So, it would probably not have been considered obscure in terms of foreign films, but it definitely was not a film that would have played at regular theaters where kids go and throw popcorn at each other.  Its driving me nuts - please help me figure out what movie this was!	movies	Maria	1	1	NA	0	NA	0	NA	NA	1	NA	0	0	0	0	0	NA	0	1	0	0	0	0	0	1	0	1	0	1	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	1	0	0	1	0	0	1	0	0	0	1	NA	NA	NA	NA	NA

Most of the movie is in this Mall if I remember well.  3. The main actor hides in a garage with a front loader to make a robbery from a van that passes by.

263215127	[SOLVED] Oldish WW2 movie or mini series	I think it was filmed in the 80s early 90s and made for tv. And I think it was in 2 parts.  The movie starts prewar with a group of 3 (maybe more) friends in Paris. There is 1 woman and 2 men that I remember for certain. They know a war is about to break out and they all have to return to their home countries, they agree to meet back up in Paris after the war ends.  The woman I think was french or she speaks french very well. She is a part of the french resistance.  One of the men is german, and is an officer in the army. He is a soldier, not a nazi.  The other man is english, or one of the  any american soldiers who were based in England during the war.  One scene the woman has been stopped by german soldiers looking for resistance people who just attacked something (I think she shot the german soldier she was sleeping with). Her german friend just happens to be there aswell and asks what is going on. As the ranking officer he looks through her bag, spots a gun says there is nothing and hands the bag back to her.  They all cross path with eachother in some way.  After the war ends they do meet up again, but I don't think they all make it there (I think but am not sure, the german dies in a battle where the english/american is on the other side).  One scene I'm not sure is from this movie. The woman sleeps with german soldiers for information, but the local peolpe don't know she is resistance and after the war or towards the end of it they beat her up and cut off her hair. This is how the english/american friend finds her. And he yells at them in a pub or similar and asked them what they did during the war.	movies	Mette	1	1	NA	0	NA	0	NA	NA	1	NA	1	0	0	0	1	NA	0	1	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	1	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	1	0	0	1	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	NA	NA	NA	NA	NA
263906081	Cant remember the name of this movie!!	I have been looking for this film for ages but I cannot remember enough to track it down. It is about a guy who wakes up and his thumb/finger has been amputated. He is then kidnapped by this guy who wants revenge for something the did to him. The man being tortured cannot remember what he did to this man and admits to horrible things he thinks the guy might want revenge for, it is not those things and the torturer finds the other people he wronged and lets them also torture him. In the end of the film it turns out the torturer is really crazy and wanted revenge for something trivial like throwing his keys over a fence. I think the film was Australian.

263952424	shotgun shell movie	I'm looking for the title of a movie (or made-for-TV movie) that I saw only once on TV many years ago. It's a suspense/thriller that must have been made sometime in the 1980s or 1990s. I don't remember much about it but the last half-hour involves a woman being stalked by a murderer in a modern house (IIRC, it may have been an office building). The climax takes place in a glass-walled bathroom where she manages to kill her tormentor with nothing more than a baseball bat (I think) and one shotgun shell (which her stalker has, along with the shotgun). I seem to remember the title being one word long and that it started with a 'T' but I've done a lot of searching with no results so I'm probably wrong about this.

229555246	Romantic movie - need help with it's name	It's a romantic movie about two people. A wife has got an Alzheimer's disease, so her husband reads her diary everyday to make her remember things they have been doing together since the youth, thus making her happy. At the end of the movie they both are died. The husband never left his wife, although he knew, that reading her wife's diary is a pointless try to make her wife start remembering everything by herself. After he read the diary (everyday) her wife starts to remember everything by herself just for a minute. Then she starts to freak out.

265075274	Looking for movie titles	Hi everyone   First of all I would like to apologies if this has been posted in the wrong area.   Second I have some questions about some movies I am trying to get information on   I am look for name of the following movie titles, these movies I haven't seen since the late 80's   First movie is about a prehistoric armoured fish it looked like Dunkleosteus, however it might have been genetically engineered to look like a prehistoric armoured fish! I would have to ASSUME the film is set in America and around about the time of the original Jaws maybe late 70's or 80's (Time might be wrong) it wasn't Deepstar six and I don't think it was Leviathan (it was set in land a either on a river or lake sorry memory is fuzzy)   Second movie is about a Egyptian Mummy in a Pyramid, I vaguely remember it killing people and at the end it is revealed this Egyptian Mummy is a Alien, and is beamed upto  a Alien Mothership at or towards the end of the movie!   Third movie, set on a farm (I remember a old guy maybe a Grandad(Grand Father) or old father or uncle and his daughter/niece and grand kids and Aliens appear from inside of a mountain. Can't remember any more details.   I only vaguely remember these movies, so it's possible some details might be wrong, and I am really struggling to recall huge details.

230420088	Trying to remember a space sci-fi movie	Long ago, maybe the '80s, I saw a low-budget, space sci-fi film on TV. I'm trying to recall the title to see if it's ever been available on VHS or DVD.  The plot was that a news crew is visiting a new luxury space liner getting the company tour about how grand and luxurious their new star ship is. During the course of the interview/tour the news crew discovers that the ship was originally planned as an inter-galactic research/exploration ship but that budget cut-backs and political concerns canceled that project and the company took over the building project and turned it into a cruise ship. One little inconvenient fact was that an idealistic young scientist had volunteered to be sacrificed so that his brain/psyche/intelligence could be implanted into this research ship on the promise that he'd travel beyond the known galaxy and now he was going to be a cruise ship for rich business men and tourists. In the end, his psyche takes control of the ship, tells everyone that he's going on the original mission of exploration and that if they don't want to come along, they better get off. The ship then takes off for another galaxy.  I seem to recall the word ""Star"" being in the title. Maybe ""Bright Star"" or something like that.

228907821	Short film, toddler drives car while parents sleep.	There is a short film about a boy, no older than 4 or 5, who drives around town. I'm pretty sure that it's while his parents are taking a nap, and he steals the keys. I'm pretty sure that he comes back and puts the keys back before they wake up, and nothing really major happens while he's driving. He just sort of drives around and I think maybe waves at people.   It was a color film. It was made in the 1990s or before. I saw it on a show in Portland, Oregon called Bohemia Afterdark, which aired in the middle of the night and showed really obscure stuff.   The actors were all Caucasian-looking, but I can't recall if they spoke English, or if there was any dialogue at all, though I'm pretty sure that they did speak.

When I was much younger I saw a glimpse of a movie on TV. I think it may have been set in Italy (or Italian suburb somewhere) or it could have been European even. Not sure as to where the movie was from (I was probably 10 back then).  All I remember from the movie was this young teenager going into a shop. From memory he ducked under the shutters to go in, the shop might have been closing or opening. I believe it was a bakery. In which there was a rather large woman working.  It could have been set in winter as she was wearing a few layers of clothing. Now that I think of it, I don't think there was any dialogue at all. At this point, the woman grabs the young teenager and pushes his face against her breasts, she pulls her top down and makes him suck her nipples. After a few minutes (it left like), she lets him go and the kid leaves the shop.  That's all I remember from it. And since I can remember I have been trying to work out what movie it was.

I've seen this about 20 years ago.	movies	Vivien	1	0	NA	0	NA	0	NA	NA	1	NA	0	0	0	0	0	NA	0	1	0	0	0	0	1	0	0	0	0	1	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	1	0	0	1	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	NA	NA	NA	NA	NA
230530856	Whats this movie solved	Don`t remember too much of this film but here goes... It`s a martial arts film, probably late 90`s. I think the main character may have been a Bruce Lee fan, he was black with an afro... I think his dad/grandad set him on a mission or something. There was a scene where he was getting his head dunked in a barrel of water by the villain, then he was surrounded by a golden ora, said `I am the chosen one` and kicked ass. That`s all I got, cheers :)	movies	Marijn	1	1	NA	1	NA	0	NA	NA	1	NA	0	0	0	0	0	NA	0	1	0	0	0	0	1	0	0	0	0	1	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	1	0	0	1	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	NA	NA	NA	NA	NA
265958594	maybe 1970s horror, not much to go on	Do not go gentle onto other boards.    If this is a movie (it might be a half-remembered dream) it's probably a 1970s/early 80s horror movie (theatrical release).  All I remember: scenes in woods, with dirt roads (maybe vehicles), and probably a swimming hole or similar (not sure if anyone was swimming).   Also, perhaps scene(s) in a cave or underground room.

265573718	Need help to remember movie title - SOLVED	I'll try to list some things I can remember about it. Sorry if I don't include many details, if I could remember more I probably wouldn't need to post here.  The movie is a thriller/crime. It is at least 10+ years old.  I'm sure the name of it was some mental illness, like Insomnia, Disturbed, Amnesia. I've searched these titles and others, plus went through a dozen lists of peoples favorite thrillers, still can't find it.  It's about a married couple (white woman, black man). Have no idea what the full plot is about, but the husband ends up being a murderer or abducts other woman (something along the lines of this). His wife finds out earlier in their relationship(?), but she has memory loss.   Events lead up to her rediscovering his crime(s), with some scenes showing where the husband kept the women he abducted, there is a room somewhere in the house with a bed in it, perhaps chains/handcuffs etc and I believe her memory comes back after seeing all of this. I'm 100% sure the husband was a black male, older and possibly chubby (large at least). I think she ends up killing the husband over it.  One event which I remember is the wife walking along the road at night in some mental trance, heavily raining, and a car nearly hits her. Might have been on or near a bridge. The occupant of the car gives her a lift to her house, I think this is around the end of the movie because she kills her husband around this time (well, the story begins to unfold at this point anyway).  Some details could be incorrect but this is all I can offer. Thanks for any help :)	movies	Marijn	1	1	NA	0	NA	1	NA	NA	1	NA	0	0	0	0	0	NA	0	1	0	0	0	0	1	0	0	0	0	1	0	0	1	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	1	0	0	1	0	0	1	0	0	1	0	NA	NA	NA	NA	NA

263523094	movie with a 'dud' bomb - very likely solved by The_Herald_Erjen	I have a vague memory of watching a movie on TV when I was very young, 7 or 8 probably. This would have been in the late seventies, so I expect the movie I'm trying to name would be from roughly that era.  My only memory of it is a group of men tossing a bomb that is about to detonate from person to person, waiting for it to explode, until they realize the bomb is a dud. I think this was the climax of the film  that is really all i remember, and i don't know how solid that memory is, for that matter.  I don't remember what kind of movie it was, what the setting was (though I have the feeling it may have been some kind of ww2 comedy).

264561040	RARE: A prince kid comes to our world to fulfills wishes until sunsets	the bad man in the magical world causes a green smoke to spread there and it starts to kill residents in the kingdom.  The king and the queen sends their child to our world, where he needs to fulfill wishes for someone, 'cause this somehow will save their kingdom.  The kid prince arrives in the middle of a basketball game, sitting on the basket ring, and the kids are asking him questiones. he tells them what he came for but they dont believe him, except for one kid who decides to check it.  after the prince proves it to him, they walk and the human kid sees a girl he likes and wishes to become her best friend, the prince tells him it's done and he goes to her and says hi, but after her referring to him as a girl he moves his head to the store's window and looks on his reflection, discovering the prince turned him into a girl (:  another wish is to become popular and he becomes a movies-star with lots of money.  By midafternoon the prince power becomes weaker, and the prince becomes weak too. they hurry to the prince's world before the sun sets, and when they reach a cliff the prince is really weak and needs help. They gets into a shopping cart and the prince makes it fly with his finger, the human kid is holding his finger high and saying ""Fly"" or other word together with the prince, but the prince is too weak now and the sun is setting, they probably won't make it.  I've found only another post about this movie, Copying here:   This is a movie/TV film I've been trying to find for a very long time. I have searched the internet, Google images, IMDb and I have been very unfortunate.  I remember the following:      Possibly in the 90's     Australian and/or New Zealand accents     Starts with a high school brat being waken up by his mum     He meets a prince dressed in gold/made up in gold - the prince does all kinds of tricks and impresses the high school brat. I specifically remember a scene in a basketball court at a school.     The prince was shorter and maybe he was of Indian/Pakistani origin.     The high school kid is taller and white.     The prince seems to come from a castle up in the clouds     The story is about saving the castle or some candle which if it lights out , they lose their magic powers     Towards the end of the movie I remember a pram with the brat dressed as a baby (a spell was cast on him) going through a forest full of green evil(?) people. I remember they took a jump from a cliff in the forest to reach the magic castle to save it from the evil woman. They kept saying this magic word 'khoo khoo khooo' to get to the castle as if they needed the energy/power for the pram to fly high enough to get there.     I remember the prince waking up in the castle being served cereal that were different colours     There was an evil woman at the castle up in the skies that was threatening/putting in danger the prince's parents.  That's all I can probably remember.

It was like a gathering, and I remember two people on the coach, this woman was sitting by herself when she was approached. And someone offered her a job, based on a mission they had completed together or something, hence the gathering. And she asked if she had to wear the uniform, and they told her yes. And I think somewhere else in the room, two people had found each other.

Can't remember any of the plot points, I can only remember some parts close to the ending. Movie definitely was NOT emphasizing on prostitution, was more like a setting.  this reporter / journalist gets to know a girl  said girl is a prostitute  in one scene, reporter / journalist goes to find girl at whorehouse, is mistaken as a customer, has to pay to meet girl. When he picks her, the others around her congratulate her as she has serviced 500 clients.   so the two go the the room, she begins to strip, but he tells her that he's not there for 'it', he is actually there to tell her something. at this point, is the only quote I remember from the subtitles ""How about Monroe"" ""no"" ""But everybody loves Monroe""  much closer to the ending, the guy wakes the girl, and they both cross the border (IIRC to Malaysia) and the two go on a hot air balloon ride to see the sunrise..  LOCATION SETTING : in a small town    EDIT: Emm.. I think the couple was crossing from Thailand to Malaysia. Also, the reason I'm asking here is because I've tried all kinds of word combinations on Google, which led me precisely nowhere, which is why I'm here, hoping for some help. So, a little help please?

264926781	70s/80s anthology comedy.	Looking for the title of an italian anthology comedy from the 70s or 80s. I only remember two segments:  1.the protagonist of this story is a football referee. he was played by a famous at that time italian comedian, a short, chubby guy with a goofy face and black hair, I think Bobo was his stage name?  He had a hot wife who was making a cuckold of him the whole time, I think with football players of the teams he was refereeing. I dont remember if he was oblivious to the situation or he knew it but was too weak to do something about it. In the end of the story, he catches his wife in bed with a man, I think his best friend. The hero appears wearing his referee suit, whistles his referee whistle and shows a red penalty card. Then a huge, black guy appears, grabs the man who was with his wife and starts beating him.  2.the protagonist is a taxi driver who is obsessed with his taxi car. he pathologically loves it and take cares of it. for example, there is a scene where there is a watery pothole on the road. he stops the car, goes out, covers the hole with a blanket and then drives his car on top of it.  He takes for passenger a bride. She tolds him that she was kidnapped by a rich family and forced her to marry someone, but she escaped from the wedding ceremony and now they are after her.  Soon, a big chase starts throughout the city (Rome?), with the taxi driver and the bride trying to evade their pursuers. During the chase, the taxi car suffers from multiple crashes at the driver's horror. Finally, he manages to arrive at the home of the bride's family. Everyone thanks him for saving the woman, but he is sad because his beloved car is completely trashed.  The next day, the taxi owner wakes up and when he looks out of his window, he sees the woman with her family and next to them a completely new taxi car which is identical to his old one. The woman tells him it is their gift for saving her and the man becomes ecstatic and starts kissing the car and jumping all over it.  and that's all I can remember. anyone knows the title of this comedy?	movies	Vivien	1	1	NA	0	NA	0	NA	NA	1	NA	0	0	0	0	0	NA	0	1	0	0	0	1	1	0	0	1	0	1	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	1	0	0	1	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	NA	NA	NA	NA	NA

265873326	Two Romanian documentaries	I'd like to find two Romanian (or maybe Hungarian) documentaries from late 90s-early 2000s.  1. The documentary follows the lives of two homeless teenagers, a boy and a girl (age 15), that live on the streets, maybe on a railway station. Maybe they ran away from home. At one point the girl becomes pregnant and gives birth to a baby boy. In the end they can be seen living in a country with her relatives and the boy is 1 year old.   2.The documentary shows Gypsy children living next to a trash heap. They work at day by looking for valuables in this heap. They also go to school, one scene shows how they wash up and prepare for school. I'm pretty sure the name was ""Trash heap"" or ""Trash Mountain"" but couldn't find anything similar.	movies	Mette	1	1	NA	0	NA	0	NA	NA	1	NA	0	0	0	0	0	NA	0	1	0	0	0	0	1	0	0	1	0	1	0	0	1	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	1	0	0	1	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	NA	NA	NA	NA	NA

261912117	Can anyone identify this tragic old movie ending?	I remember having seen the end of an old, B&W movie as a kid and have been trying to identify it ever since.  I would guess it came out between 1950 and 1965. Its main character resembled Steve McQueen, but I've gone through a list of his movies and none of them seem to be this one.  The ending I remember had him and what I took to be his maybe 10-year old boy on a boat, a few miles out in the ocean.  The boy was sick in bed that morning and the father came down into the room he was in and asked if he wanted some hot dogs for breakfast, when he realized he was dying.  The boy then died and the movie ended to sad music, with the grief-stricken father slowly carrying his son's body along the beach.  My guess would be that the father had been a fugitive, and that after his son died - possibly because this kept him from getting him medical attention - he just didn't care anymore.  It seems this would be the ending to a classic, but I've looked for this for years and haven't found anything with this kind of plot.	movies	Marijn	1	1	NA	0	NA	1	NA	NA	1	NA	0	1	0	0	0	NA	0	1	0	0	0	1	0	0	0	0	0	1	1	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	1	0	0	1	0	0	1	0	0	1	0	NA	NA	NA	NA	NA
264714972	Movie title (one more)	Hello. Looking for one more movie title.  Genre: B category action movie with Sci-Fi elements  Year: 1990-2000  Plot elements: there is a scientist who develops/steals some kind of wrist devices (wrist watches) that can heal any damages one sustains. He uses some kind of a teleport (or time machine) device, comes to a wedding ceremony massacre and resurrects the groom with those wrist devices. The groom needs to rescue his fiance from some men who kidnapped her. Meanwhile on his travel to the bride, they have a car crash and the scientist dies in the explosion. The groom was given the wrist devices before the scientists death and he uses them to rescue his bride. There was a moment where he touches an electric fence in order to electrocute a bad guy. As he had healing wrist watch, after he fell unconscious, he was resurrected. At the very end, he found the main bad guy, all three of them fought and were seriously injured. He uses the two last wrist clocks for him and his fiance while the main bad guy dies and does not get healed.

It took place in Arizona or somewhere with like surroundings (desert-ish). The alien's ship looked like a huge rock that had an eerie green glow to it at night. The aliens were replacing the humans of the near by town one at a time. The mother was one of these humans to be replaced but despite her being an alien she protected her child and would not let him get turned.

265904526	Movie/TV show with creature crawling out of washing machine?	I'm pretty sure this one is from a horror movie (or could be a TV show.)  This is an image that pops into my head every so often. The only thing I remember is that a person hears a noise in the laundry room. They go in to inspect and see the washing machine (one of those that opens from the side and not at the top) is on and a woman, or a creature taking the form of a woman, crawls out of the machine and scares the person.  I think it may be something from early to mid 2000s, but I'm not 100% on that. Could also be a Japanese horror movie or an American remake of a Japanese movie.

The reason I enjoyed this movie so much is the way that lies are portrayed visually: as each murderer interacts with police, we hear what the man says but we see what he is remembering.

265800179	Movie with 2 ""false starts"" (Solved)	I always meant to ask this. Now that the board is going to disappear I guess it's now or never.  I started a movie on HBO sometime in the 80's I think. It started with people at a funeral out in a cemetery. As it ends, the mourners walk away but one woman stays behind and talks to the coffin saying that he was a wicked man and she's glad he's dead.  Suddenly the coffin opens and the old man inside pulls her into the coffin as she fights him.  The coffin then gets lowered into the the hole and down into an area like an automated crematorium.  There is a worker there (maybe more) but they are listening to music on earphones and turned the other way so that they don't see the coffin headed into the flames with the woman's legs sticking out struggling to get out.  Then the scene is pulled back to reveal that this is on a movie screen at a drive-in.    There's a young couple in the car watching the movie, and the guy asks the girl to go get them some food. So she goes into the confectionary to get some popcorn. She sees spooky-looking characters lurking around. They slowly turn into zombie-like creatures and surround her.  Then the names of an artist and singer appear on the bottom left of the screen. The picture is pulled back to show an editor working on a music video.   By that time, I was bored stiff and changed the channel. My questions are - 1.) Does anyone know the name of this movie? and 2.) Were there any more ""false starts"" after those two?

262891049	Help With Title Of Movie From 1990s	I think it was in the 90s but could even be from the 80s.   It was a UK straight to DVD movie with a very low budget. One of those DVDs you could rent for 1 a week back in the day!  I remember two men in suits meeting up with a group of volunteers for a new experience/game. I don't think it was VR, but it was some kind of game that played tricks on the mind so the volunteers would see things that they were afraid of possibly by taking a drug beforehand.   I remember the volunteers were in a building and each had their own room and I think that inside that room was something which they were very frightened of, so the thing they were frightened of is personal to them. I think the game was to enter the room and see how long they can stay there for before being too scared.   I'm not sure if it is the same movie but I keep seeing some guy shooting a green laser gun at a humanoid monster and I remember a Scottish accent.  The episode Play Test from Black Mirror reminded me of this movie so I am dying to find out what it was called.	movies	Maria	1	0	NA	0	NA	0	NA	NA	1	NA	1	0	0	0	0	NA	0	1	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	1	0	0	0	0	0	1	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	1	0	0	1	0	0	1	0	0	0	1	NA	NA	NA	NA	NA

265441870	Name of a Christmas Short Film	Hello.  I've been trying to remember the name of a film, (Probably short film, but I'm really not positive) that played every Christmas or Christmas Eve, but I believe Christmas morning around 7:00 AM in Australia.  I have some memories of this film and will state them below.  This film was about and man and his donkey in a desert. He may have been a wise man, but that was the way he was depicted, even if he was not an official wise man. He came across many obstacles in his journey, but the main part that I remember, is that every time he returned to his donkey, he would pull out a portable set of stairs and place them down to climb onto his donkey, then returned them to his bag or wherever he kept them. These stairs kept appearing throughout the film.  I apologise for the lack of information, and unsureness on some facts, but would love if someone recognised this and could tell me the name of this film from my childhood.

265776108	Movie - man and woman voluntarily stranded on an island	English-speaking movie, probably from the '80s, but no later than the '90s.  A man advertises for a woman to join him on an island for a year. He is recently divorced. (I'm a bit iffy on the details here, but that's the gist of it.)  No romantic involvement is intended initially, but does eventually develop in that direction. They eventually agree that sexual needs need to be satisfied, and she agrees to have sex with him on regular intervals. They eventually cut the adventure short when they find out she's pregnant, towards the end of the film.  Remembered dialogue:  ""That's a house, Charlene!"" At least I think it was Charlene. He was pointing to the shabby and rickety shack he had made out of sticks and leaves, when she was complaining about his contribution.  ""A statue of a goat would make you horny right now!"" Spoken by her during a storm, as she tries to save their ""house"" and possessions, while he tries to force himself on her because the next sex session was due.  From the beginning of the movie, I remember the man's ex-wife complaining to him about the fibs he told their son, such as fish feeling no pain when one extracts the hook.   And that's it. I don't even remember if I really liked it or not, but I thought I'd get the question out there before the Dark.	movies	Marijn	1	1	NA	1	NA	0	NA	NA	1	NA	1	0	0	0	0	NA	0	1	0	0	0	0	0	1	0	0	0	1	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	1	0	0	1	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	NA	NA	NA	NA	NA

The wife tries to wake her husband, but he is out cold. One of the daughters says ""what did you do to him???"" The wife replies ""nothing""  There is a dinner scene with all 7 of them, and the 2 eldest daughters are picked up for dates. The father assures the youngest daughter that it will be her turn to date soon.  The young wife spies on the 2 daughters and a sex scene ensues. The father slaps a mosquito on his neck and spooks his houseguest.  I vaguely remember the young wife having an affair with either the father, or maybe the groundskeeper of the house?  The young wife and the 3 girls go to a bar in the hills next to the lake. The bartender either says he won't serve women, or won't serve them specifically... (The 3 girls and their family had a bad rep in town) And the young wife reminds him it is illegal to serve liquor on a Sunday, so they eventually get served.

225138717	80s Saturday Morning movie *UNSOLVED*	There was a series that aired on Saturday mornings in the 80s, it was either the Captain OG Readmore series, or one similar to it, but they showed movies, or cartoons. They'd show stuff like Chocolate Fever and the like.  The one movie I'm trying to remember is a live action movie about these two boys, coming back to school for the new year after the summer. One of the boys brings their teacher a gift because he knows shes a pretty lady, and I believe the gift is perfume.  On the way to school they somehow get distracted, and end up getting wet by either falling into a river or lake or something and I think they get to school late and they're soaking wet.  Then when they get to class, the teacher they were expecting had actually left and was replaced by a man. The male teacher sees the gift sitting on his desk (and if I recall correctly the gift is also soaking wet).  This is where it gets a little unclear:  I believe there's something to do with a statue at the school and I think they put a bra on it, or something... I'm not 100% sure this is from the same movie, but I think it is.  They seem to be at odds with the new male teacher, but I think by the end of the movie they end up respecting him because he helps them out. I think.  Anyone remember this?	movies	Maria	1	0	NA	0	NA	0	NA	NA	1	NA	0	0	0	0	0	NA	0	1	0	0	1	0	0	0	0	0	0	1	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	1	0	0	1	0	0	1	0	0	0	1	NA	NA	NA	NA	NA

225948189	Can't think of the title	So I just was thinking about this movie that I saw a few years ago.  I think it had to do with mental illness and may have taken place in a mental institution.   All I can remember is this one part of the movie where two or three of the characters go to maybe a fair or carnival of some sort. I want to say that they got permission to take a day trip or something. I think they drove themselves there too, and I want to say it was in a VW bug, but I could be wrong.  One of the characters (I think he thought he was a superhero maybe?) ends up jumping off of something from a great height and dies or gets badly injured.   Unfortunately that's pretty much all I can remember from the movie. I wish I knew an actor or something, but I don't.  I just watched the movie Manic, and it made me think about this movie that I'm trying to find the name to.

229563672	can anyone name this film	Being driven crazy trying to remember a film I saw a few years back.It was an American comedy which I would guess to have been made in the nineties.All I can remember is a young man trying to get a girl but nothing goes right for him.One scene I recall is when he is trying to disguise himself and does so by making facial hair from used waxing strips from a beauty salon he is hiding outside of.He is helped throughout the film by a pilot  with a false leg who is always claiming to be of many different nationalities( perhaps with a name something like digger- could be totally wrong on that).The only other part I can recall is where they tow a banner behind the plane with a message for the girl he is after,but part of it gets torn off totally changing its meaning for the worse.I think at the end they get together on top of a tall building.Afraid I cant remember any of the stars,just hope someone can help.

262410590	70s'/80s' film about an evil kid killing siblings? (SOLVED)	I think this one was a British film.   The family finds and then takes in a very young (perhaps an infant, initially) blonde girl left by some mysterious woman.   As the girl grows, she starts killing off the other children in an variety of ""accidents.""   The father eventually realizes what the little girl is doing, and tries to strangle her.   The mother intervenes in time, and obsessed with protecting her last child (and not suspecting or believing that the girl really killed the other kids), divorces the man.  The final moments have the man in a park, trying to convince his friend what really happened.  The analogy of a cuckoo bird (IIRC) comes into the conversation.  One of the men compares the girl to a cuckoo chick, who are known for invading other birds' nests and kicking out the other chicks in order to have the mother bird to themselves.   The father then sees that same mysterious woman leaving another stroller with a baby.  Realizing the entire process is about to begin again with another unsuspecting family, the man chases after her.  He is unable to find her, though, and the movie ends.  I had thought the name of this movie was ""The Godchild"", but nothing came up on search matching what I'm looking for.   Can anyone tell me the actual name of the film?

I remember the main bit of the movie was about a sentient being I think it was a kind of human clones which are all the same. In either case the military was using these to sweep minefields by just having them walk through and try to blow themselves up, after which the ones that lived were rewarded with candy. One of these things which were thought to have no emotion or idea of self preservation survives a minefield sweep by pushing another into a mine so that it survived and got candy instead of dying which raises moral questions of these beings place in society.	movies	Maria	1	0	NA	0	NA	0	NA	NA	1	NA	1	0	0	0	0	NA	0	1	0	0	0	0	1	0	0	0	0	1	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	1	0	0	1	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	NA	NA	NA	NA	NA

About a stripper or prostitue who works at a club out in the desert probably somewhere near Vegas. I remember the main actress works with a group of other women. There is a scene where all the women are lined up and a guy picks the youngest looking woman that dresses like a really young school girl.    After sleeping with the guy the main actress and some other workers ask her how can she sleep with a guy like that. She says because as long as she keeps sleeping with him it means that no teen girl will be harmed. Meaning the guy clearly had issues and he was getting his sick fantasies done with this young looking woman.

8og6c9	Pick it up, pick it up, put it in your/the pocket! (Not the Stan Ridgway song)	I'm looking for a song I briefly listened to while browsing a huge abandoned vinyl collection about 10 years ago. All I have left in my memory is a snippet from the lyrics. I cannot for the life of me remember the name of the band or the song, but it's stuck in my head ever since I heard it. I only remember the intro, a sort of whispered intro over a simplistic beat, in which the following lines were repeated: *Pick it up, pick it up, put it in your/the pocket.* *Pick it up, put it in your/the pocket.* In my head I see the album cover as picturing 4\-5 men \(band members I would think\), but this may be incorrect and it doesn't really narrow anything down. We are definitely talking 1980s pop, though, and most likely something not very well known. Googling the above lines only brings me to the Stan Ridgway song, which is not the one I'm looking for. LONG shot here, but maybe one of you can help.	music	Marijn	1	NA	NA	1	NA	NA	0	0	0	0	NA	1	1	NA	0	1	NA	1	0	0	0	0	1	0	1	1	0	1	0	0	0	0	0	0	NA	0	0	0	NA	0	0	0	1	0	0	1	0	0	1	0	1	1	1	NA	NA	NA	NA	NA

8p2b9b	Post-breakup music needed: non-English	I want non\-English music because I don't want to either associate a song's lyrics with this time, don't want to hear love stories, nor do I want to commiserate or bash. The radio is my bane right now and I don't want to understand what someone else is singing about. I just want to enjoy it for the tones/melodic sounds/wtfe. Looking for background music. Could be shoegaze, blues, indie folk, and so on, but no lyrics in English. Occasionally a band will do an album in their own tongue, then occasionally have an English song; that's fine.	music	Marijn	1	NA	NA	0	NA	NA	0	0	0	0	NA	0	0	NA	1	0	NA	1	0	0	0	0	1	1	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	1	0	NA	1	0	0	NA	0	1	1	1	0	1	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	NA	NA	NA	NA	NA

The music video starts off with a film reel showing off branding and what not then the actual bulk of the video is footage of the singers girlfriend as they hang out and go to a carnival and lay in bed together. The girl is the only one who ever appears in the video. I'm also certain there are points in the video where they bowl and look at flowers together. The song includes an acoustic guitar and what from what I can remember, the theme is about finding the one he will marry.

I had totally forgotten that song existed, but today I was listening to Børns, and something about that music triggered a memory of it. I think the singer has the same high voice as him. I remember it being awesome imagery of the a turquoise blue ocean and something about the color gold...maybe a sunset? It had some sad lyrics. The main singer was male but I think there were other singers. I think it would've come out around 2007-2012.

8pih9x	Help me find this Eurodance song from the 90's	Hello everyone. So, I've been listening to many Eurodance megamixes over the years and there is one in particular I can't find anymore. In this megamix, it plays 'Sweet dreams' from La bouche and it slowly switches to a song that I've desperately been trying to find for the past 2 years without success. I'm not 100% sure about the lyrics but it begins like this: 'All I need is you Nothing else but you? All I need is youuuuuuuuuuuuuuu All I need is you!' I might be missing a line here, it's been so long. I'm not totally sure it's the beginning of the song as it's a megamix but the way everything sounds, it seems to be the very beginning of the song. I don't really know how to describe the voice but she really insists on each 'you' she says. I'm mainly looking for the song, not the megamix.	music	Mette	1	NA	NA	1	NA	NA	0	0	0	0	NA	0	1	NA	0	1	NA	1	0	0	0	0	1	0	0	0	0	1	0	0	0	1	0	0	NA	0	0	0	NA	0	0	0	1	0	0	1	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	NA	NA	NA	NA	NA

I couldn't catch the lyrics proper, since I heard it at a crowded restaurant. You guys are my last hope. The song seems like a new-ish song. Sort of like trap and slow beat and the main hook is of a girl singing 'No no no no no no no no no no no no no no no no' . The 'No's' are not exaggerated. Those are the exact lyrics. It can be 'Na Na Na Na' also. I'm not sure. I know this is too much. But please give me the name.

8s7hge	Seeking some help trying to find a song	Hey everyone, I heard a song playing in my local barbershop which had a 4/4 rhythm and a distinct disco vibe and a repetitive lyric which I thought was 'turn up for me' sung once every 3 bars and 'so lovely' on the fourth. This repeats a lot throughout the song with some other verses thrown in between but I couldn't make out any words. After a lengthy google search I'm pretty sure the lyrics are wrong but could be similar, ie. 'turn up the heat' or 'too good for me' etc... any help would be greatly appreciated!	music	Maria	1	NA	NA	1	NA	NA	0	0	0	1	NA	1	1	NA	0	0	NA	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	NA	0	0	0	NA	0	0	0	1	0	0	1	0	0	1	0	0	1	1	NA	NA	NA	NA	NA

8scvax	Jazzy pop song heard at water park	I heard this song play over the speakers at a water park. They were playing mostly pop music and top 100 tracks from the last year or two, so it's probably recent and something that gets radio playtime. This song was more of a pop/bossa nova sound, and it had a very different feel from your typical top-100 tracks. It's a pretty relaxing/chill track. Airy female vocals. Reminds me a bit of The Girl from Ipanema in the style of the vocals. Or maybe a bit like Lorde or Norah Jones, but I couldn't find it in their discographies. The bass line is a string of quarter notes on the same beat. The bass line is very prominent. About 100 BPM.	music	Toine	1	NA	NA	0	NA	NA	1	0	0	1	NA	1	0	NA	0	1	NA	1	0	0	0	0	1	0	1	0	0	1	0	0	0	0	1	0	NA	1	0	0	NA	0	0	0	1	0	0	1	0	0	1	0	0	0	1	NA	NA	NA	NA	NA

8qi3i7	Oldie but goldie I can't get out of my head.	I was listening to the classic station on my radio that has music from the 60s-80s and this song came on that was pretty groovy and catchy but I can't remember what it's called. The only lyrics I remember fully are 'I'm lookin' for a good time, good time.' With the last 'Good time crescendo-ing upward. This is most definitely not the Alan Jackson song Good Time or most any similarly titled songs. It's an old song from between the 60s and 80s and if I had to guess the genre I'd say either R&amp;amp;B or Rock. Another clue is that the lyrics leading up to the 'Good Time' part rhymed with the last words ending with -ay.	music	Toine	1	NA	NA	1	NA	NA	0	0	0	0	NA	1	1	NA	0	0	NA	1	0	0	0	0	1	0	0	0	0	1	0	0	0	0	1	0	NA	1	0	0	NA	0	0	0	1	0	0	1	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	NA	NA	NA	NA	NA
8r7bif	Dreamy/Dark/Surreal J-pop?	So. Recently I finally got myself a Japanese iTunes account. I'm looking for some music that could be considered 'dreamy' and/or dark.

(I couldn't find a video of this one outside of karaoke covers.) I'm really into the kind of aesthetic that stuff like Serial Experiments Lain, Yume Nikki, Madoka Magica, and LSD Dream Emulator have. Dreamlike, dark, atmospheric, sometimes with kind of a late 90s feel. I'm sorry if this post is an absolute mess. I'm trying my best to get across what I'm looking for.

I believe the song mentions power lines as well? I do think it was about an apocalypse. The song itself was interesting to hear, not your typical rock or pop or indie song. I know it was released between 2000-2010. I don’t know the genre. The vocals were soft, male, no deep voice. I even tried finding it in my recommended.

The style of the music was similar to a Latin jazz percussion, mixed with a funk sound. The chorus would slow down however to a similar style as Bowie's space oddity, with various 'spacey' sounds layered in. Now to the more identifying points; the lyrics. The most notable lyrics repeated several times throughout the song, and also being the only lyrics I remember clearly, are 'under a blood moon' which (from memory,but I could be wrong) is the opening line, and is mentioned several times, most notable after the chorus. 'In my/a spaceship built to last' mostly mentioned during the chorus, and finally 'up, up, up and away', also said mostly during the chorus, with variances on the number of times 'up' is repeated. The context of the song is it's a love song. They mention holding their lover in their arms, flying in their spaceship, and holding and/or meeting their lover under the blood moon. Any kind of info on the possible origins of this song would be very much appreciated thank you :)	music	Maria	1	NA	NA	1	NA	NA	0	0	0	0	NA	1	1	NA	1	1	NA	1	0	0	0	0	1	0	0	0	0	0	1	0	0	0	0	0	NA	0	0	0	NA	0	0	0	1	0	0	1	0	0	1	0	0	1	1	NA	NA	NA	NA	NA
8q5sjo	More like Down to the Fire by Uncle Acid and the Deadbeats	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zJVOb1eXKks I love this sound. It's got a nice bright, driving, but easy-going melody with an acoustic guitar, and features a flute, like a medieval song or something. But I look up medieval music and it's just so pompous sounding; not smooth and relaxed like this, and honestly not enough acoustic guitar. I should add that the drum style and driving tempo are important, but I'm mostly just trying to get started looking for more stuff like this. Is this like a sub-genre of folk music? What should I be looking for here?	music	Maria	1	NA	NA	0	NA	NA	1	1	0	1	NA	0	0	NA	0	0	NA	1	0	0	0	1	1	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	1	0	0	0	NA	0	0	0	NA	0	0	0	1	0	0	0	0	1	1	1	0	0	0	NA	NA	NA	NA	NA

I finished a show on Netflix (Sherlock, if you care, and yes you should watch it if you haven’t) and a trailer for LUST stories started playing. Needless to say, I can’t identify the song (Shazam and Sound Hound couldn’t recognize it, I Googled the lyrics to no avail, and even Googled how to Google finding a song - nothing). Anyone out there know it? My fiancée will adore it and I adore her, so any help is very much appreciated! I’m attempting to link the YouTube video but am tech literate, not savvy.

8sqac6	Similar songs to JAYYEAH - LIL RAV3 GIRL	Looking for something like this https://youtu.be/4PgMEHF2dxI The vocals really make this track, they give it a nostalgic feel for me not that I even knew the original by Basshunter before this. So if anyone could recommend more nostalgic tunes that sample vocals and are generally washed out/reverbed i'd be really grateful.

8rpa9z	Need Help Finding a Song I Heard on an Alternative Music Station	Earlier this week, while listening to an alternative music station , and they played a song I had never heard before (and haven't heard since). The lyrics that I can remember are: 'I was better off single' &amp;amp; 'Time keeps on ticking by'. I also want to mention that the song has a somewhat melancholy feel to it. I've searched google and youtube, and can't find it. The closest I've come is this song: ([https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8ws2Ne8TpKo](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8ws2Ne8TpKo)), and although similar, it's not the same song I heard a few days ago.

8sxngp	Can you help find a music video my late father loved?	Hi. My father passed away several years ago. He loved music, and often played music videos for me. He played one for me repeatedly, and I can't remember the song in it, just the images. There was a pier with a storm happening. There was a person wrapped in wire. There was a cradle or basket (presumably with a baby in it) appearing in different places. The video is from the 2000s, is rock (I think), and features a male singer.

I don't remember the name of the song or artist, and I don't even know if the song or band was particularly well known. My guess is that is was kind of a 'one hit wonder,' but probably not even as well known as that. It did get radio play, if I remember correctly. It would have been between the years 2003-2005 or so. It has a feeling similar to 'Sweet Home Alabama' by Lynyrd Skynyrd or 'Life is a Highway' by Rascal Flatts. I think it was about driving or a road or dancing or something along those lines... It had a strong, driving beat and at the end of the song there is a choir or a woman kind of singing in the background. I was on the West Coast at the time if that helps (Seattle area). That's all I got! Give me your best guesses, this is driving me crazy haha.

8oyuei	What's the name of the song in A$AP Nast's Instagram story (in the 4th &amp;amp; 5th section)? His handle is: asvpxnvst	I don't have access to Shazam or SoundHound right now so I can't figure it out. He posted it an hour ago and it's after the part of his Instagram story where he is promoting Rocky's new Praise da Lord music video with Skepta. The song sounds like it's French lyrics with smooth, spacey, vibey production.

8r4qy0	Albums like 'Dreaming Out Loud' by One Republic.	I'm looking for more albums like One Republic, but with a 'Stop And Stare' acoustic take. I love the Pads in the introduction, and then the pads being mixed with the alternative rock instruments. What type of songs or albums that implements this idea? I mostly like PADS, but not the ones in shoe-gaze music, even though that is just exaggerated reverb on a guitar. I'm just looking for both male or female songs that has a well balance mix, but a strong drum kit.	music	Marijn	1	NA	NA	0	NA	NA	1	0	0	0	NA	1	0	NA	0	1	NA	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	NA	0	0	0	NA	0	0	0	1	0	0	0	0	1	0	0	0	0	0	NA	NA	NA	NA	NA

It's an instrumental piece, probably from one of the 1001 YouTubers that makes songs and remixes. I first heard it in one of Jacksepticeye's videos where he's touring Orlando Studios, but it's easiest to hear in this Film Theory video, where it starts around the 14:30 minute mark, just ignore the guy talking: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=w45Vc3uv1Yk It's a very pleasant piece and I'm dying to know its name (and many others are judging from the comments in the videos).

I thought the song name was 'Let Me Go' but google isn't finding it buy the singer i heard. she sounded a lot like Adele maybe, had that kind of rough toned singing voice. It was definitely a sad kinda song where she was telling someone to forget her. I'd love to listen to it again if anyone can help me remember who sang it please.	music	Marijn	1	NA	NA	1	NA	NA	0	0	1	0	NA	0	0	NA	1	1	NA	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	1	0	NA	1	0	0	NA	0	0	0	1	0	0	1	0	0	1	0	0	1	1	NA	NA	NA	NA	NA

8oj0v4	Help finding specific songs/styles (psychedelic-ish)	Hello everyone, So, today during a drawing class I looked in to a friend's drawing notebook and saw a bunch of her drawings with weird/abstract names. Much later I came to learn those names were from the songs that she was hearing when drawing them. As such, I tried finding more about these songs but the internet is one big mess and my memory is about as good as that of a goldfish. I know for a fact that the style of those songs is usually something closer to psychedelic genres, but that is way out of my knowledge. So, here are a few key ideas of everything I can remember that should help those of you more knowledgeable on the matter find these songs I speak of. Thank you in advance: .As stated above, these songs fit in the dreamy/psychedelic styles of music, something reassured by the drawings that came with it. They may also be about themes of sadness, depression and (perhaps) suicide, as some drawings suggested the presence of cuts and 'killing pills'.; .One of the songs, featuring a girl holding two of the pills I spoke of, had I name in the lines of 'A//D'. I am almost 100% sure the letters were A and D but it may or may not have been more than one '/'. Also, there can be a ' 's ' in the end, I can't quite remember; .Another song had a french title, I know it was small and from my limited french speaking abilities, didn't contain any word out of the basic vocabulary. It ended in 'rentrer', meaning re-enter; .A song was called 'boyish', but I found more than one on YouTube and though I think it is the one from Japanese Breakfast, I cannot be sure; Once again, thank you in advance!	music	Marijn	1	NA	NA	0	NA	NA	0	0	0	0	NA	1	0	NA	1	0	NA	1	0	0	0	0	0	1	0	0	0	0	0	0	1	0	1	0	NA	1	0	0	NA	0	0	0	1	0	0	1	0	0	1	0	0	1	1	NA	NA	NA	NA	NA

Song starts at 20:39, it's played behind Hyebin (the group leader) giving some commentary on the talk show, so depending on whether or not you're in Mobile you might need to turn it up. Here's the link: https://youtu.be/jP3m0yXhq_o Skip to 20:39, the song was very popular back in ?2016/2017? and I've asked nearly all my friends/family if they remember the name and no one can help me.

8op34g	Seeking name of heavy / viking metal song	Hi guys, For a couple of years, I've been trying to track down the name of a heavy / viking metal song that I've heard, loved, and forgot the name of. The outro is amazing, and for memory, has these elements: - Sounds kinda like Amon Amarth. - Fairly sure it has flute. - Possibly has some synth, too. - The vocals sound kinda like chanting. - Rolling bass drum during the outro. - Strangely, the login screen music to Final Fantasy XIV Online reminds me of the song - https://youtu.be/4Yvku87BlHE I've been struggling to find this by googling, and I've spent many hours on Spotify, with no luck.

So my hubby was listening to Nena-99 red balloons and it jogged something in the back of my mind and now I really want to find this damn song but I have very little to go by. Bless anyone who tries to find this song. - I saw it on youtube. - It was a music video - It featured a man and a woman - I saw two songs by them (? can't remember if they were a duet or a feat.) - It was weird and trippy in color and theme - If I recall correctly the man often had his face famed among fruit and his face was painted in the same color - It was either the video I'm thinking of or the other one, but the woman at some point was on the ground or in a tub of milk - I think they were singing about loving each other - I vaguely get the impression there was some sort of throne or goddess worship Good Luck and god speed.	music	Toine	1	NA	NA	0	NA	NA	0	0	0	0	NA	0	0	NA	1	0	NA	1	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	1	0	1	0	0	0	0	NA	0	0	0	NA	0	0	0	1	0	0	1	0	0	1	0	0	0	1	NA	NA	NA	NA	NA

8s8x7e	funky/upbeat song about dancing and not letting naysayers get you down	The first verse involves the singer (not sure m/f, I think m with high voice) saying people tell them to slow down or that they need to think real, etc., but they just keep going anyway, they don't let anybody bring them down, they just get up and shake their booty... I believe it's a recent (&amp;lt;10 years) song that has the sound of an 80's/70's tune. I can't nail down any melody or chorus but could've sworn it was used in Guardians of the Galaxy since it had that kind of dancing, old-school, happy feel to it (although apparently it wasn't).

8qei5p	Vaporwave-esque song with repeated 'shwing' sound..?	I have severe memory issues and have rooted through my history years back trying to find this gem, and feel hopeless. I remember very little, but maybe it'll sound familiar to someone. This is a challenge for the people of this sub, and it'd be a miracle if anyone actually knew what I was on about, but here goes. What I remember: The song was quite chill and laid back, the voice sounded as though it had been put through a couple forms of compression, the video/album looked purple and pink with some sort of triangular shape. Most recognizably, the song had a sample that plays through the whole thing every few beats. It's highly noticeable, almost the main feature, and sounds a lot like the 'shwing' sound of a sword being drawn in an old cartoon or show.

8pdy77	Commercial song from the early/mid 2000s	Hello, everyone. I need help trying to find a song from a 2000s commercial. Unfortunately, I can only remember a small portion of the song. I tried to whistle it here: https://vocaroo.com/i/s0zWsjs8DHTM. I believe the commercial was for a car. I'm not entirely sure, though. I'm pretty sure the part I whistled was the chorus and was actually whistled near the end. At the beginning and throughout, the chorus repeated a 'wooh\-hoo' or 'yoo\-hoo' that followed the same whistled tune. This song could have very well been from the 80s or 90s. If I had to give it a genre, I would say alternative rock. The singer (there might have been two) was male. Any help is greatly appreciated.	music	Marijn	1	NA	NA	1	NA	NA	0	0	0	0	NA	0	1	NA	0	1	NA	1	0	0	0	0	1	0	0	1	0	1	1	0	0	0	0	0	NA	0	0	0	NA	0	0	0	1	0	0	1	0	0	1	1	0	0	0	NA	NA	NA	NA	NA

8qtdvg	Old TV show theme? Maybe a comedy?	I am not quite sure how the song goes. But it might be some piano in an upbeat blues type of manner. So there is a few couple seconds of piano, then a short pause with a short monotone whistle. Then a little bit of more piano (like 2-3 seconds maybe) and then another pause but this time two short monotone whistles in a row. Then a little bit of piano for a few seconds and then another pause with two short monotone whistles and a highpitch whistle. That's all I can remember. By the sound of it, it's a comedic theme or something like that from the 20th century.	music	Mette	1	NA	NA	0	NA	NA	1	0	0	1	NA	1	1	NA	0	0	NA	1	0	0	0	0	1	0	0	0	0	1	1	0	0	0	0	0	NA	0	0	0	NA	0	0	0	1	0	0	1	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	NA	NA	NA	NA	NA

Like the lyrics were just incorporated as a backing thing. By 'live kind of thing' i mean it was like a recording of a band playing. Not electronic at all. I just forgot what song by Daft Punk coz I got drunk but it has a very lovey dovey vibe. It's definitely something from Discovery and I think the song sampled was digital love but like I said I'm not sure because I was drunk. I've been looking for the song for the past week (the dude sounded like Xavier Omar but I searched through his stuff and do daft punk stuff) and it's driving me insane.

The first line I remember is 'All I think about is cash' the second line is 'I don't give a damn...' Not a lot I know but if you figure it out I'll love you forever. I think it must be really new cause I haven't heard it anywhere yet but it sounds like one of those newer rappers, short quick verses about having cash and a lotta cars.	music	Toine	1	NA	NA	1	NA	NA	1	1	0	1	NA	0	1	NA	1	0	NA	1	0	0	0	0	1	0	0	0	0	1	0	0	0	0	0	0	NA	0	0	0	NA	0	0	0	1	0	0	1	0	0	1	0	0	0	1	NA	NA	NA	NA	NA

8oo7z6	Loud punk/rock song, only remember bits from the music video	I think it is punk, or something similar. I distinctly remember the colour red, and that the singer had black hair, maybe spiked or messy and played a salesman or something similar in a department store, or it is something related to IT. The music was loud and obnoxious (lots of screaming), and I think the video had special effects such as speeding up to accompany and zoom-ins on the singer. I think the band/song name was pretty weird too. I would be surprised if the song wasn't pretty famous. I probably heard the song 6-8 years ago on youtube.	music	Marijn	1	NA	NA	0	NA	NA	0	0	0	0	NA	1	0	NA	0	1	NA	1	0	0	0	1	1	0	1	0	0	1	0	1	1	0	1	0	NA	1	0	0	NA	0	0	0	1	0	0	1	0	0	1	0	0	0	1	NA	NA	NA	NA	NA

8q5obd	French song I heard back in elementary school.	So back in elementary school, (in rural New Brunswick) we had a small concert at my school. I remember it was my 4th grade teacher's brother's band playing. They played a song I can only describe as a french version to the Irish song *Rattlin Bog*. We did a little dance with it too, but I can't remember anything other than that. I'm hoping that that song wasn't just a cover made by some local Acadian band, and is at least somewhere on YouTube or something.

8odzwe	70's song from mix or 'sunny' FM stations about taking his woman out to see some ocean sights... popular oldies	I don't know the lyrics, nor the tune, just the vibe, the general genre, the context and where I heard it. It's in the vein of 'dancing in the moonlight' or 'Brandy \(you're a fine girl\)' and it was played on a station that played that type of music, but this song is swankier. The guy is confident, singing with a very persuasive tone that he's going to take his muse 'around' to see some sights and show her a good time around the sea or the ocean or the harbor or the bay ??? \(I Cannot recall any actual words used to describe any of these things\) The song is alluring/cute and doesn't sound like a real old song, so I'm assuming it's late 70s. That is just an assumption. Please god help me this is driving me crazy. I want to say he is describing different things they are going to see and I recall it is a lot of nautical stuff. I cannot be more specific because I'm afraid I'll start putting words in there that aren't in there, but it's like he's just going to cruise around ON or IN the ocean to impress her.	music	Marijn	1	NA	NA	1	NA	NA	0	0	1	0	NA	0	0	NA	1	1	NA	1	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	1	0	0	0	0	0	0	1	0	NA	1	0	0	NA	0	0	0	1	0	0	1	0	1	1	0	0	0	1	NA	NA	NA	NA	NA

8qnxaj	Trying to recall a song I found on youtube awhile ago.	There aren't any vocals, only piano. Maybe some added sounds but the main focus is piano. The title or theme the song tries to convey is something related to living with depression. The song gets more dreary as it goes on and towards the end, the piano starts being played out of tune and errors seemed to be made, maybe to add to the theme of depression and it getting worse to deal with. I came across it randomly on youtube one night and have thought about it from time to time but I can't seem to find it.	music	Marijn	1	NA	NA	0	NA	NA	1	0	0	0	NA	1	1	NA	1	1	NA	1	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	1	0	1	0	NA	1	0	0	NA	0	0	0	1	0	0	1	0	0	1	0	0	0	1	NA	NA	NA	NA	NA

8qxqoo	Chill track, higher pitched yell from a man followed by duun du dun Du duuun du du Du duuun	I've been at it half of my night.. I want to sleep please. It's a slower track, you could put it in the chill playlists. Capital letter is a higher pitched tone. I remember two parts of the track. One part is in the title. The other part is about the same, but the pitch increases somewhat if I'm not mistaken.

8ql27s	Please Help me with that amazing song!!!!!!!	Please, I'm looking for the name of this song. A program called Boomerang transmitted as a form of commercial some interviews to the protagonists of an Israeli series called 'Split'. The background song of that interview is what I've been looking for for many years. First of all, I clarify that I am a native speaker of Spanish and I do not understand the lyrics of the background song very well. Please, the people who speak English perfectly, help me to find the name of this song looking for the letters in the search of google or as you want. The Spanish-speaking people who love this series are going to thank you very much.I will attach the links. https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vrFGfX2Q2ig https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EhEyxThTdMo https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=t-RvPIBc1f8	music	Marijn	0	NA	NA	0	NA	NA	0	0	0	0	NA	0	0	NA	0	0	NA	1	0	0	0	0	0	1	0	0	0	1	1	0	0	0	0	0	NA	0	0	0	NA	0	0	0	1	0	0	1	0	0	1	1	0	0	1	NA	NA	NA	NA	NA

I work in a supermarket and hear this on the radio at least once a day but can't find what song it is, even through searching up the lyrics that I remember. It's a mid-tempo ballad, the chorus lyrics are: 'Hold onto me, hold onto me, I am escaping' repeated twice, which is followed by this basic guitar melody. I will link a midi mock up I made from memory, down below:	music	Marijn	1	NA	NA	1	NA	NA	1	0	0	1	NA	0	1	NA	0	0	NA	1	0	0	0	0	1	0	1	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	NA	0	0	0	NA	0	0	0	1	0	0	1	0	0	1	1	0	1	1	NA	NA	NA	NA	NA

8pd995	Who sang this version of Simple Man?	(I know this is a bit outside the focus of the sub, but it was the best I could find.) Alright! So I decided to learn Simple Man on guitar, so I found the song online https://musicallybrazil.com/search/lynyrd-skynyrd-simple-man - the 06:36 length one. It's clearly listed as Lynyrd Skynyrd, but when I checked the song on youtube I come up with this version https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sMmTkKz60W8 which sounds like it's played on electric compared to the acoustic in the first one. The solos are also distinctly different. Well, maybe they just made 2 different version I thought to myself. But it doesn't seem so. Obviously tons of people have covered the song, but none of the 10+ bands I've checked so far seems to be the right one. So what's going on? Does anyone know who made the first version? I feel like I'm going crazy over here.

It should be much better than the online sequencer recreation.

However, I recorded a bit of the song but I screwed up some of it by talking while recording. This is all I got, with the screwed up parts removed so it cuts off twice during the sample.

It has female vocals singing that part, but some weird nasally high pitched guy singing the other parts. I don’t know the song that well, because I only heard like 20 seconds of it.

I cannot remember any lyrics, titles, or album names. All I have is a description of the album cover cause that's all my brain can handle apparently. The music that would generally play around it on these lists (that I've tried looking back at and can't find it that way) is Saimes 'The Wolf', Studio Killers, Lorn, Mystery Skulls and other similar bands, if that helps. The artist for the album covers does have a theme with all of them in that there is typically some form in shape of an old 60's wing tip Cadillac rear end, typically with one piece or bikini girls jumping off of the end into a pool. The one I'm thinking about specifically is placed on an older style tube TV as well I think. I did try Googling these keywords, no luck. Any help you guys can provide would be the best.

It’s bugging me like crazy!!	music	Toine	1	NA	NA	0	NA	NA	1	0	0	0	NA	0	1	NA	0	0	NA	1	0	0	0	0	1	0	0	0	0	1	0	0	0	0	0	0	NA	0	0	0	NA	0	0	0	1	0	0	1	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	NA	NA	NA	NA	NA
