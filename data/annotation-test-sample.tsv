111795	book	jdoc-annotated	librarything	YA fantasy: boy meets shadow people. It may be upper level children's instead. It's pre-1980s and is about a boy who goes to a house with a garden. When there he discovers and befriends shadow people. Anything that casts its shadow in the garden is then around for the shadow people's use. There are statues in the garden and a dolphin statue is important. I seem to think it's how he was able to see the shadow people but I'm not certain. There's a portion where he takes his birthday cake outside so the shadow people can have some too.
109493	book	jdoc-annotated	librarything	"YA SciFi with """"energy particle"""" alien who visits boy. I read this YA SciFi book in sometime around the late 80s or early 90s. The protagonist boy gets visited by an alien who takes the form of energy particles that are like static and the boy can feel them as tingles. The first time they """"meet"""" is in the boy's bedroom at night. There is a scene early on where the boy is walking down his driveway in the winter and realizes he has been floating because he has not left any footprints in the snow (the alien made him float somehow). Eventually, the alien takes the boy on the spaceship (which I believe has a transparent floor or wall so he can see space) and they go to a planet (might be the moon, not sure about that). Unfortunately, I don't remember much else about it. Thanks for any help!"

53741	book	jdoc-annotated	librarything	Need help with name and author. I read a book many (10-15 or more?) years ago and I would like to read it again. I know that there was a woman spending time alone sorting through her life. She was in the northeast (Cape Cod? Nantucket?) - I think in a house on a beach. One distinguishing feature that I do remember is that she either had been to or was planning to attend the annual meeting of the Modern Language Association (MLA), I believe in New York City. So I think she was some variety of an academic. If you don't know that one, but know of others with similar characteristics (especially woman taking time by herself in a house on the beach to figure out who she is and where she is going), I would be interested in those too.
63477	book	jdoc-annotated	librarything	novel, monk gathering St. Catherine's relics. Fiction I read this around 2000, it was absolutely not written after fall of 2001 since I read it before I went to Europe and I was looking for Catherine's Wheels in all the art while I was there thanks to this book. It was a novel, about a monk in the medieval period (I think, I'm suddenly unclear about this) who was seeking to gather together the relics of St. Catherine. Possibly ended in a hermitage in Alexandria. The monk could hear her scattered body parts talking to him, but his order did not feel that he should be doing this, so some other group is maybe trying to stop him or collect her before he does? I'm fuzzy on this. I don't think it was marketed as a supernatural book, or a religious book, or a crime thriller, but more just a story/novel. It may have had the word Translation/Translated in the title (not referring to translation of the book, but the religious term of translation in terms of the removal of relics). Arrgh, this is driving me nuts. Thanks to anyone who can help!

There's also a cop who steals paintings and then returns them to the police station to show people how easy it is to break into their houses. At least one was new within the last 5 years, maybe.
21768	book	jdoc-annotated	librarything	help finding a book. Perhaps 5 years ago I read a book (I think the book was newly out then) about this woman who finds a time travel portal on her grandparents (I think it was) farm in the mountains somewhere in the eastern U.S. She goes through and finds herself in old England. It seems as if she has to disguise herself as a boy. The portal on that side is in a church I believe. She finds the love of her life in old England. Travels back and forth . Discovers that one of her relatives had also done the time travel. If anyone has any suggestions for me I would certainly appreciate them.
8o9kr3	game	jdoc-annotated	reddit	[Sega Saturn] Fantasy JRPG from magazine preview. **Platform(s):** Sega Saturn **Genre:** Japanese-produced Fantasy RPG (not sure if JRPG) **Estimated year of release:** mid/late in Saturn's release cycle **Graphics/art style:** 3d characters and environment, mostly isometric camera angle **Other details:** This has been bugging me for a while - I remember reading a preview of a fantasy rpg for Saturn in some magazine but I don't know if it actually came out or what it's name was. The only thing I really remember is a screenshot of the main character (some sort of fantasy knight) standing in a town/village on a raised walkway. The palette was very grey/washed out, and the town seemed to have lots of raised walkways that crossed back and forth. It reminded me very much of the Genesis game 'Light Crusader', but if it was done with 90s 3d. From what I can remember it was more 'low' fantasy/medieval rather than high-fantasy particles and magic.

Ship upgrades like guns etc.. wanna say you could encounter aliens Other: I know this is terribly vague considering it sums up 90% of all space games, but it's been a very long time since I played it. I remember it having 3 panels one on left,bottom, and right with main screen in between them. Been trying to remember it for the past 2 years but my memory is shot. I could however pick it out from a screenshot I'm positive.
8r5tco	game	jdoc-annotated	reddit	[NES][90s]Sidescroller with a dog sidekick.. This is driving me INSANE. **Platform(s):** NES **Genre:** Linear motroidvania **Estimated year of release:** 1990s **Graphics/art style:** 8 bit, several landscapes **Notable characters:** You are a fighter with a dog as a sidekick, the dog performs attacks occasionally. The original boss is a giant guy that takes up 1/2 of the screen. You know when you're closer to beating him because his face changes from purple to red or vice-versa. Occasionally, you'll run into a shop keeper as you're working your way across the level to buy new abilities from that you can perform with your dog. **Notable gameplay mechanics:** **Other details:** Early on in the game, you're scaling a mountain to get to the top, fighting enemies along the way. Toward the middle of the game, you were able to fall through false pitfalls that would normally kill you, but they sent you to a secret area. Later on in the game, you end up in a volcano where pretty much everything is on fire.

8qspqq	game	jdoc-annotated	reddit	Repost [PC][90s] Anti stealing/drug/gang game.. I’m listing OP’s description of the game here because it’s much more thorough than the details I remember but I know for a fact it’s the game I’m looking for: I remember playing this game in the mid-90s on the PC that was incredibly blunt with it's messages against drugs, gangs and theft. It was a cartoon style. There were three characters and each one represented each different problem. My memory is hazy, but I think I recall the drug guy being tall and maybe red (I remember that if you win, he quits drugs and becomes a pole vaulter), the gang guy was big, blue and violent and the thief was a green woman. I remember that in order to win, you had to collect pieces of each of the character's mind and put it together for them so they could come to their senses and quit breaking the law and being a bad citizen. I never had time to get the minds of the gang guy and shoplifter. I only remember one specific scene in the game, it was with the drug user and he was showing the kids in the game how to sniff airplane glue out of a paper bag. The whole game barely pulled punches with showing the guy strung out and jonesing. That's all I can remember, the gameplay was mainly watching scenes of bad stuff, and why it's bad and shouldn't do it. I remember one mini game where it teaches you about gang colors, and you shouldn't wear gang colors, and it consisted of a choosing a color not related to a gang.

I'm trying to remember the title of a game that's relatively recent (after 2012 I believe) that is a kind of a horror survival shooter within a weird game show or that partially involved the player being part of a game show..

I remember a level that took place at a casino, and that's about it.
228520946	movie	jdoc-annotated	imdb	Can’t recall the name of an old black n white movie.. :(. The only thing I remember about this movie is that there was a rich family who were finding their daughter who was lost as a kid.. a poor girl made a plan to pretend as that lost girl.. when she reached their home then they took her to a room full of toys and asked her to pick the toy she used to play with as a kid.. she got nervous initially but then picked the right toy.. the reason she picked the right one is because all other toys were warm because of too many lights of the room.. but this particular toy was not warm as it was brought to the room just at that time for testing her..

229198425	movie	jdoc-annotated	imdb	Looking for an older SciFi movie.. The movie I am looking for is set in the future but has a older feel. I remember the main bit of the movie was about a sentient being I think it was a kind of human clones which are all the same. In either case the military was using these to sweep minefields by just having them walk through and try to blow themselves up, after which the ones that lived were rewarded with candy. One of these things which were thought to have no emotion or idea of self preservation survives a minefield sweep by pushing another into a mine so that it survived and got candy instead of dying which raises moral questions of these beings place in society.

Being driven crazy trying to remember a film I saw a few years back.It was an American comedy which I would guess to have been made in the nineties.All I can remember is a young man trying to get a girl but nothing goes right for him.One scene I recall is when he is trying to disguise himself and does so by making facial hair from used waxing strips from a beauty salon he is hiding outside of.He is helped throughout the film by a pilot with a false leg who is always claiming to be of many different nationalities( perhaps with a name something like digger- could be totally wrong on that).The only other part I can recall is where they tow a banner behind the plane with a message for the girl he is after,but part of it gets torn off totally changing its meaning for the worse.I think at the end they get together on top of a tall building.Afraid I cant remember any of the stars,just hope someone can help. Thanks in advance
