It was about a woman who falls in love with an older man.  She wasn't a YOUNG woman, maybe she was a divorcee? Maybe she had teenage or even adult kids??  (not too sure about that part)  What I do remember is that there is enough of a difference in their ages (and the man is the older one) that it is a significant issue to her friends or family, like maybe she's in her early 40s and he's in his late 60's?  (In my memory he was even older than that, but I'm thinking I watched this when I was 15 or 16, which means any man who was over 50 probably seemed ANCIENT to me.)  I remember a love scene between them, maybe toward the end of the movie, that at the time kind of shocked me because he was so much older.    Anyway, I don't remember many details of the plot, except that maybe much of the movie took place in a high rise apartment?  I always thought I remembered the main characters being played by Jane Fonda and James Garner...and because I thought it was James Garner, I always thought it was Murphy's Romance.  however, I just watched 5 minutes of that, and I KNOW it isn't Murphy's Romance, because that appears to take place on a horse ranch, and I clearly recall that this movie took place in a city.    I looked through the films starring Jane Fonda and James Garner, and nothing looks right.  I feel like I'd know the movie instantly if I saw the title.  Can you help me remember?  One final odd flash of memory that might or might not be relevant: I feel like either the title of the film or the name of one of the main characters had something to do with a little song or nursery rhyme that appears in the movie at some point.  Am I totally off on that, or does that trigger someone else's memory??  Thanks in advance for any input.  :)",,,,,

She met Robert Preston on the bus while coming home from one of her quickies, they struck up a friendship and by the end of the movie it developed into romantic feelings.  At the very end, when he finally confesses his feelings for her, they have one love scene, nothing graphic.  Kissing in front of the fire, then cut to them snuggling under a blanket together, apparently naked underneath.  Professing their love for each other and saying that they will be happy if they have 10 good years together before he's too old to enjoy it.

And I was glad to discover that I wasn't crazy, there WAS a little song that had to do with the main character's name!  Robert Preston's character was named Michael Finnegan, and he sang a little song several times in the movie:  There was an old man named Michael Finnegan, He grew whiskers on his chin-again, Shaved 'em all off but they grew back in-again, Poor old Michael Finnegan,  begin-again.

It has a dark background, and a man's figure is painted, all white, no details of clothing, no face. As she nears the painting, obviously terrified, and the music building, the figure slowly comes out of the painting and its face materializes. He is still white from head to toe, but his eyes appear (heavy eye liner) and then his mouth appears, very, very red lips. She runs out, screaming. After that, he opens his eyes and laughs.  My dad was watching this, and I was so scared I ran to the TV and changed the channel. He made me switch it back.

She then gets sick, and she can barely act anymore she thinks that the theatre show won't be able to go on, but the girl that does her make up says she has learnt all the womans lines throughout the years and is sure she could pull it off. The woman feels betrayed by the theatre people and i remember her saying a line near the end of the movie once she was replaced by the girl who did her make up or wardrobe.

268,226362459,I Need to Know,SOLVED. 90's or early 2000's thriller/suspense movie,3,226362459,1,0,1,Mon Feb 24 2014 23:11:10,ur0975354,"Hello all, I am hoping someone here can help me remember the title of a movie that I watched back in the late 90's or early 2000's.  I may have asked this here before and gotten the answer but I seemed to have note written it down or e-mailed it to myself so I apologize in advance if that is the case.  Either way though I would really like to know which movie this is.  Also I apologize in advance for the length of the post but I wanted to give as many details as I can remember to hopefully make it easier for someone to ID this movie. Okay, enough pre-lim this is what I remember of the film:  Pretty sure I watched it in the late 90's, late at night on a cable station.  Perhaps Cinemax or Showtime but I cannot say for certain which station.  I know it had to be the late 90's and I am pretty sure it was late at night because it had the feel of one of those ""almost"" a soft core movie feels to it.  It starts off in a doctor's office.  There is a woman getting examined there but you know something is not right because the lighting is kinda dark and ""spooky"" and also the music as I recall is a bit ominous/suspenseful.  Anyway, the male doctor molests/rapes the woman and then I believe kills her because she ""wakes up"" as he is doing it.  The scene then shifts to the woman's sister, who might be a cop or more likely a reporter.  The sister then decides to go undercover and find out what is happening at this clinic because she does not feel her sister's death was an accident, etc.    The whole clinic has this weird cult like vibe to it and the lighting as I recall really helps portray this feeling of tension.  There might be one of those ""experimental"" treatment angles going on with the clinic too which is why the regular cops don't want to get involved.  I feel like the doctor either drugged or hypnotized the victims so they would not wake up or remember what happened to them.     Somehow or another there is also a man involved in investigating the clinic.  I cannot remember if he is the dead woman or the sister's boyfriend or just a cop but I know he gets involved and helps the sister get out and expose the doctor and his nurse (who I think is his wife or something who helps him molest these woman who come into the clinic).  The man also ends up falling in love with the sister as I recall as well (shocking I know).    There was just this over all kinda creepy vibe to the movie with this underlying sexual tension that makes it stick in my mind.  Any help at all would be greatly appreciated.

They repaint the interior, but when they wake up, they notice that the painting in one corner or one spot of the house has faded to black. Turns out that the house is haunted, the spot being most probably the source of the ghost/ghosts. At the end, the family burns down the house.

I didn't see this...I only read from a transcript during seventh-grade reading class. The boy breaks his leg (or arm?) during baseball or softball, and is taken to the hospital where he is told about the cancer and that his limb needs to be cut-off.  by sef11-1 (Mon Mar 5 2012 22:30:36)  I responded to this last week, but your query and my response along with all of the other responses seem to have disappeared, so here is my answer again.  I know how it goes to look for something for years.  I remember a TV movie on NBC sometime in the time frame you're looking for, simply title, ""Eric,"" from 1975. It starred Jon Savage and Patricia Neal. It was about an Athletic youth, who finds out he has leukemia, and his refusal to give up. I only saw bits and pieces of the movie when it first aired, so I don't know if he had a limb amputated, but because of the time frame, I thought it might be the correct movie you are looking for.  I was in the ninth grade at the time, because I remember it came on in the time slot of my favorite TV Show at the time, ""The Invisible Man,"" which was only on during the 75-76 season.  I remember reading an article in TV guide or the Weekly Reader type magazine that was published for the higher grades, about the movie. If I remember correctly, the weekly ready type magazine often had a play of some sort in the magazine. It is quite possible it was published by scholastic, like you mentioned in your first query.  Hope this helps.  by Colonel_Steve_Austin (Tue Mar 6 2012 09:25:54)  Yes, I remember your response to the other post...but not what show episode or movie you thought it possibly was. I'm sure 'Eric' is not it as my story was bone cancer and that is leukemia. I've never heard of someone having a limb amputated because of it. But thanks anyway...and I like your last paragraph.  by sef11-1 (Tue Mar 6 2012 21:39:29)  I've thought about this most of the day, and the name of the magazine I was thinking about they used when I was in Junior High School was by Scholastic, and I think it was titled ""Scholastic Scope.""  I saw several vintage collections of ""Scholastic Scope, on Ebay. Maybe one of the covers will jarg your memory.  Just a note, both ""The Weekly Reader"" and ""Scholastic Scope,"" were published by Scholastic.  Hope this helps.  by Colonel_Steve_Austin (Wed Mar 7 2012 01:30:21)  Yes, it does! Thanks!!  by jellybeanchick (Tue Mar 6 2012 22:27:10)  I don't know this one... but I have been thinking about it lately (or possibly a similar movie). I watched it at my grandmother's house sometime in the early to mid 90s, and it was on TV, possibly a made-for-TV movie. After the boy had his arm amputated, he continued to play baseball with one arm, and his shirt sleeves were pinned up where his amputated arm was.  I was pretty young so I didn't understand the movie, and I don't know about whether cancer was involved. At the end there was a boy that got his arm cut off in an industrial machine of some sort; at that time I thought this was some other kid that was somehow inspired by the baseball playing boy but my memory is foggy.  If this is the same movie, I hope the details help. If not, sorry.  by Colonel_Steve_Austin (Wed Mar 7 2012 01:29:15)  If it was made in the 90s then it can't possibly be the same show episode or movie. Plus the arm getting cut-off by an industrial machine certainly did not happen in the story I read in class. But thanks anyway!  ----------------------------------------------------------------------------------  by LI-Mom (Wed May 2 2012 06:28:49)  jellybeanchick, I think the movie you are describing is:  A Winner Never Quits (1986) (TV) imdb.com/title/tt0092221  Two other films/shows that deal with this subject:  The Ted Kennedy Jr. Story (1986) (TV) imdb.com/title/tt0092066  Ted's cancer was discovered when he had trouble playing football, not baseball.  I don't remember too much about this episode but:  ""Highway to Heaven"" A Song for Jason: Part 1 (1985) imdb.com/title/tt0601518  It's on YouTube: youtube.com/watch?v=kVW54YWRzVM  by sef11-1 (Thu Mar 8 2012 06:06:09)  Do you remember if there were other stories in the book or magazine you read this transcript in?  Because when I was in the 8th grade, 1975-1976, I remember our teacher having us read stories in a book, besides our regular reading book. I think it was small paper bound book, and do remember there were several stories in it, but the only one I can remember vividly, was a biography or possibly autobiography, of Sammy Davis, Jr.  I remember him talking about being in a restaurant eating, and having some people, possibly young people snickering and writing something on a piece of paper or possibly a napkin. When they left, he went to the table they had occupied, and unfolded the note, to read with horror, only one word. Ugly. He went on to describe other things, and about the accident that took his eye. His only thought when it happened was, ""Please God, not my eye.""  I'm mentioning this, only because it might be possible your teacher did the same thing, and found other reading materials to supplement your reading book.  No matter what, I hope you find the movie, or possibly the magazine or book you read the transcript in.  by Colonel_Steve_Austin (Sun Mar 11 2012 21:37:08)  I remember an article on prosthetic-limbs which mentioned Jay J. Armes and the then still current show 'The Six Million Dollar Man'. I'm not sure if it's the same issue but since the boy would need a fake leg after his surgery I'm guessing that it is. This would be seventh-grade (the 1976-7 school year). I'm sure we read this in the spring of '77 so sometime from the beginning of March to the middle of June.  by vpurvis (Wed May 16 2012 14:13:25)  I remember this show during the 1970s as well. It was similar to the ABC afterschool special, but I have not seen it on any lists of the shows.  A twelve year old boy hurts his leg sliding into base during a baseball game and an x-ray revels bone cancer. The doctor told them it would have to amputate; since the bone was too close to a nerve (which even at that age I could not understand, at worse his leg would be numb, but still there)  I remember that he had to make a decision of having the operation. He had a horrifying dream of being a one-legged statue that was quite scary to me at the time.  by Colonel_Steve_Austin (Wed May 16 2012 14:24:37)  Thank you! I don't know why it's so hard to find. If it takes too long to find someday I'll just have to contact Scholastic (if they're still around, that is) and ask them. Again I never actually saw this on TV...I just read from a transcript in my seventh-grade English class. But I know it was an episode of some after-school series.  ----------------------------------------------------------------------------------  by LI-Mom (Wed May 16 2012 14:38:09)  Of course, they're still around!  I think a lot of us are going crazy now, thanks to you. You owe us. lol  scholastic.com/home  by Colonel_Steve_Austin (Wed May 16 2012 14:52:31)  Thanks for the link! So they are still around, wasn't sure. Like so many other things from my childhood I thought they might not be around anymore. I should have just check to find-out. Even though we had and read from Scholastic in class, I still don't know if they did transcripts from shows, or if what I want is another publication? As soon as I stop being so lazy I'll contact them (hopefully they'll still be here like they are now). Lol. Thanks again!!  ----------------------------------------------------------------------------------  by LI-Mom (Wed May 16 2012 15:02:55)  It's kind of nice to know it's still around, isn't it?

Sincerely,  Lacy  Original Message: From: gmail.com Sent: Friday, March 08, 2013 10:20:05 PM To: MAG_RNT1@scholastic.com Subject: Old back issue for grade 7, 1976-7 school year  Greetings, Not sure if this is the right department to contact about this. However, I'm looking for a specific issue (which I'm not sure is yours, or not) that contains a transcript story of a television special program to read a loud in class. It's a transcript of an after-school or Saturday program concerning a young boy (12 just like a 7th grader) who gets bone cancer and needs to have his leg (or arm?) amputated. Any and all help would be greatly appreciated! If it's not your publication, then who's do you think or know that it could be? Thank you for your time and consideration. Sincerely  ""Lt. Merriman was dead; the brains cooked-out of his skull over an Apache torture fire."".  ----------------------------------------------------------------------------------  by LI-Mom » Thu Mar 28 2013 16:01:47  Hey Pope!  Just this morning I was thinking that I should look for this thread & bump it up.  Great minds think alike, huh?  Well if our minds were that great, we'd have solved this mystery by now. lol __________  ""What we've got here is a failure to communicate."" ~ (Cool Hand) Luke  ----------------------------------------------------------------------------------  Unfortunately Scholastic turned-out themselves to not be much help. I think I'm going to have to get a catalog of all their magazines for seventh-grade for the 1976-7 school year and look through it myself to find this. It would really suck if this turns-out to be a competitor instead.  ""Lt. Merriman was dead; the brains cooked-out of his skull over an Apache torture fire."".  ----------------------------------------------------------------------------------  by LI-Mom » Thu Mar 28 2013 16:12:54  I have faith in you.  Last night I was trying to help someone else with a mystery from childhood.  I suggested to her that maybe via Facebook or Classmates.com she could ask her own schoolmates if THEY can answer her question.  It's worth a try, Pope. __________  ""What we've got here is a failure to communicate."" ~ (Cool Hand) Luke  ----------------------------------------------------------------------------------  Thanks for the suggestion but I'm not into Facebook, Classmates or any other of those sites. I'd rather recontact Scholastic and ask about getting a catalog and the price for it.  Also just think none of the great here (star-core, filmlady, killer_croc, etc..) have tried to answer this...  Actually star-core did post in the original thread here: postimage.org/image/6fprrmp7r/full  postimage.org/image/6fprrmp7r/full, but he didn't offer anything toward solving this.  ""Lt.

Never been comfortable with it, that's why it takes me so long to get around to it (or the nerve as some would say). When on the phone I'm actually more comfortable with a recording than a live-person on the phone if you've seen commercials where they say speak to an actual live person instead of a recording. A recording can't make you feel like you're being pressured as a person can.

511,219815802,I Need to Know,[UNSOLVED] British miniseries,5,219815802,1,0,1,Wed Sep 18 2013 07:09:00,ur3663630,"NOTE: I have deleted my replies that had the additional information and incorporated them into the original post.  I think this was British but it could have been made elsewhere and I think there was only 2 episodes (however it may possibly have been a one-off). I don't remember the story but I think a boat and its captain were involved. The main characters were a family (father, mother, son) and I think they'd been asked to help put some crooks away.  I remember them meeting said crooks in some sort of rundown town sort of like the town in the game Max Payne 3, and the son had a tape recorder to record the conversation. The thing that stands out about this scene is the fact the tape got the end, and rewound and it could be heard. They told the crooks it was a cassette player (oldschool, one that played music) and they didn't suspect a thing. I'm not 100% sure but I think the father may have been asked to smuggle drugs through and airport at one point (they were in his stomachs connected to a string, I think).  **ADDITIONAL** I'm sure it was broadcast in between 93 and 98 (when I was at high school) but no later than 2001 (I watched it at my previous house and that's the year we moved). The genre should be a drama thriller, mostly drama I think. Also, I believe the scene in the airport has the father exiting the toilet area but not quite reaching the main area (where you check in, etc), and I'm sure he gets arrested at that point but I'm only about 40% sure about that.   **ADDITIONAL** I just possibly remembered more about it, but it might be another one altogether. I remember seeing something about a freighter with black slaves or immigrants (I'm sure they were stowaways). One particular black man was crawling around the airducts and such trying to escape after his friends were either captured or killed after being discovered. I'm sure it was a two-parter, but what I'm not sure about is whether it's part of what I originally posted.   If it is a part, then the crooks I mentioned were probably in the business of smuggling black slaves as well as drugs, or maybe the drugs were just there as an attempt to get the father arrested. The parts of what I've posted so far that I'm 100% positive are part of what I'm after as a whole, is the scene with the tape recorder and the scene with the father. I'm 50% positive on the rest.   The family were definitely Caucasians, and I can't remember any of the stars involved, or who may have written or directed it. It would be great to be able to see this again after all those years since it's initial broadcast.",,,,,

Not sure if it was a TV movie or what. The one scene that has stuck with me is a bunch of people start throwing rocks at a guy and his head comes off his body and rolls over the hood of a car. That's all I remember so I know it's a long shot. A similar thing happens in The Omen but that is not the one I remember. It could've been a mannequin. Ring any bells for anyone? Thanks.,,,,,

I described one brief scene where this dark-haired woman (who sort of reminded me of the actress Lily Tomlin) was seen cooking in her kitchen, the woman wore a bathrobe/raincoat, I do not think she had any curling irons in her hair. She had a pot of boiling water on her stove. She was famished and searched her almost entirely empty refrigerator only to find a minimal amount of things, one being a big can of pet food (I think dog food). I think she poured some into the pot, and then fed some to her dog/cat only to eat it herself. The pet, and I strongly believe it was a dog rushed into the room (it was small and grayish white if I remember right) and saw her eating its food. She looked back at it with this horrific greenish face while growling. and the pet quickly rushed out of the room from fright, as understandably so. Now, I saw this on TV sometime around 1990-91, but someone here said they saw it sometime in the 80s, and this was all they could remember as well, and it was in color. Most suggest this is a werewolf film, but I am not entirely sure. The woman could have been a witch, or maybe she was demonically possessed, or just had rabies (maybe the pet food was poisoned). It is NOT:  Any of the Howling films Mom My Mom's a Werewolf The Boneyard The Kiss The Sixth Sense Harry and the Hendersons  I doubt it is an episode from Beyond Belief: Fact or Fiction"", but for some strange reason, I remember it being loosely based on a true story. It was not a commercial, maybe but quite possibly not, too strange and long. It had a ""Tales from the Dark Side"" sort of feel, I considered ""the Casavin Curse"", and ""Love Hungry"", but neither is it. I am considering one of the films from ""the Curse"" series, ""Sleepwalkers"", or ""Mutator"", but as I said, I strongly believe it was a dog not a cat. I must also add I heard about this anthology film, where this woman (who turned out to be a witch) killed three-four bicyclists, putting their parts in either a regular pot or a cauldron, forgot the title, unfortunately. Already copied onto the ""horror"" board, but if you have any ideas, please post, thanks.",,unsolved,,,

They maybe taret cards but I am not sure. And I feel like it happened on a bridge. And there maybe someone who figures it out that its going to happen and they try to hurry and save them but it is too late. The movie might have something to do with demons or curses or something like that but again I am not sure. If any of this rings a bell please let me know. Thanks!!,,,,,

I'm trying to recall the title to see if it's ever been available on VHS or DVD.  The plot was that a news crew is visiting a new luxury space liner getting the company tour about how grand and luxurious their new star ship is. During the course of the interview/tour the news crew discovers that the ship was originally planned as an inter-galactic research/exploration ship but that budget cut-backs and political concerns canceled that project and the company took over the building project and turned it into a cruise ship. One little inconvenient fact was that an idealistic young scientist had volunteered to be sacrificed so that his brain/psyche/intelligence could be implanted into this research ship on the promise that he'd travel beyond the known galaxy and now he was going to be a cruise ship for rich business men and tourists. In the end, his psyche takes control of the ship, tells everyone that he's going on the original mission of exploration and that if they don't want to come along, they better get off. The ship then takes off for another galaxy.  I seem to recall the word ""Star"" being in the title. Maybe ""Bright Star"" or something like that. Any guesses?",,,,,

A man is running down horizontally along the wall fastened with harness. A man shoots down at him from a building across the street. the bullets shatter the glass around as the man thunders down.

The relationship between the U.S. and China was mostly on-again off-again, with periods of both cordial diplomatic relations accompanied by times of severed relations and violent anti-United States protests.  In the 1920s and 1930s, the Asiatic Fleet was based from China, and a classic image of the ""China Sailor"" developed, as a large number of U.S. Navy members would remain at postings in China for 10–12 years then retire and continue to live in the country.

The male teacher sees the gift sitting on his desk (and if I recall correctly the gift is also soaking wet).

One of the characters (I think he thought he was a superhero maybe?) ends up jumping off of something from a great height and dies or gets badly injured.
