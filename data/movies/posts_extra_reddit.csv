Eventually, another woman comes into the room holding a knife and the two of them start talking to each other. Their conversation is calm, but the latter's way of speaking may have been condescending or vengeful in someway. She takes her knife and teasingly plays with the bubble bath foam and says something shocking to the bathing woman in which she replies ""How did you know...?"" This reply is said in an almost whispery voice because for some reason, the bathing woman is slowly losing consciousness. They exchange a few more words and then eventually the bathing woman loses consciousness completely. The knife wielding woman then leans over the bath and pushes the now unconscious woman's head into the water. The camera cuts to first person perspective of the unconscious women drowning, and the credits start to fade in as air bubbles quickly overtakes the scene in the background.

They find her in the building but get locked in and have to find a way out. At the end of the movie it starts all over again. I remember one of the guys getting seperated.

What I got from their explanation was that it was about a 13 year old girl who rode horses for her whole life. She would write stories (??) and apparently the stories she wrote were all true events from her past she had forgotten about. She slowly realizes it’s happened before. Then I guess the instructors(hub and wife) rigged it so she was always top rider and the husband would wine and dine the 13 year old girl. Apparently she partook I’m sexual acts with him but thought as if that was the norm and there was nothing wrong with it. That’s all I got... any one know?,4,,,,

One of the most vivid things I remember about the movie is that the boy, who I assume was about eight years old, hides in the bathroom on the airplane for most of the flight, to the point where a stewardess has to rescue him before the next flight departs. As the boy is getting off the airplane, news footage covering the September 11 attacks is being shown around the TV screens at the gate. Distraught, the boy reveals to the stewardess that his father worked in the World Trade Center. Well, I think that’s all I remember. Thank you so much for your help!!",1,thanks?,,,

The film was fairly dramatic in its portrayal, but essentially the whole film showed all the various ways that plants have adapted to their environments and want nothing more than to multiply and spread themselves around to take over the surface of the earth. I don't remember many details from the movie, but I distinctly remember there being an entire, somewhat dramatic segment of the film describing in detail how certain plants have adapted themselves to spread their seeds over long distances. It has been a long time since I saw the film, and there isn't much else I remember of it, but I'd love to find it again and be able to spread the message of the wonderful and terrifying world of plants.

He ends up pulling a gun and demands the money. The interesting part is that they relatively quickly turn the tables on him and tie him to a chair. So they're stuck with this guy who has intimate knowledge of the crimes the two men have committed and no idea what to do with him. I think the situation kinda flips a few times with each party having the upper hand at different points in the film.

It might have been on Nickelodeon, like one of those Halloween movies they play around October, such as Halloween Town or something similar. It starts with a family moving into a new house, a mother, father, and three kids, the older brother, middle sister and youngest son. So they move into this new house, and there is a metal address sign on the house that is hanging sideways, so the Dad fixes it, thinking the address is 999 but then you realize the address is supposed to be 666. The parents leave on the weekend of Halloween so the kids throw a huge Halloween party at their house. The older siblings walk into a room and find the little brother playing poker surrounded by older girls in really skimpy costumes. The parents call the older brother on his cell phone and ask how everything is going. He says everything’s fine and the little brother is surrounded by half naked girls, but don’t worry because it’s “part of their costume.” Eventually the little brother goes missing and the older brother and sister have to team up with some of the people from the party to find him. After looking through the house for a while, they find these tunnels that go under the house. Somewhere along the way, they get a really cryptic message from someone telling them to “follow the stars.” They go into this tunnel and when they come out, they are in the middle of Hollywood and they realize the stars they are supposed to follow are the stars on the Hollywood walk of fame, and following these leads to the safe return of the little brother.

However before they start crossing one of them fears it might be a trap, so they proceed to try and lift another log found by the side of the road to use as an alternative bridge. Turns out that second log was a trap and mines went off (paint), signalling they had been eliminated. 2. Different scene, in an army camp. Something something and a general or drillmaster challenges recruits to hand to hand combat in front of the others. He goes on to seriously injure one of the volunteers. He then asks if anyone else wishes to step forward, and no one does, except a woman. She is stronger than the recruit and manages to get a few hits in on the drillmaster, but ends up getting hers in the end. 3. Same setting as (2), but a recruit contradicts the drillmaster on another occasion. He asks the recruit to place his hand over a bullseye target used to train combat knife throwing. The drillmaster proceeds to throw a knife at the hand of the recruit. Yeah. All in all i guess it was a pretty violent and gruesome movie, but it’s come up in my head recently and I can’t seem to get it to leave. Any ideas? Thanks!",1,thanks?,,,

They were probably released between 2003 and 2009. I had them on a CD of movies I'd watch on childhood road trips. The first movie is an anime if i remember correctly. At one point there is a scene in space, involving things that look like [czech hedgehogs](https://www.google.com/url?sa=i&amp;source=images&amp;cd=&amp;cad=rja&amp;uact=8&amp;ved=2ahUKEwiG-MXZg7nbAhUIq1kKHVVyDLcQjRx6BAgBEAU&amp;url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.artstation.com%2Fartwork%2FAEZam&amp;psig=AOvVaw2wgRhIxlyR-ikmItmun5Ti&amp;ust=1528168030952907) made of ice. They're a little thicker than the picture. They float in space and crash into each other, I think. That's all i remember. The **second** movie is animated \(not anime\). There's a world, with a ton of buildings on it, and the buildings all get fucked up and destroyed, and they end up floating in the atmosphere of the planet like [this, but higher up in the sky](http://i.kinja-img.com/gawker-media/image/upload/t_original/yhrs5vnlrdlllqdwzcwj.jpg). They are huge, tall buildings. The main character is floating through the destroyed buildings on a small platform made of stone \(that was part of a building originally\). Just for redundancy, anime as in Castle In The Sky style, and animated as in Shrek style. I looked through six pages of google image results for ""floating buildings destroyed/ice spikes in space/czech hedgehog ice/ice space anime"", all that. Found nothing.",1,,,,

This is only my second post, so please forgive me for any mistakes! I have lurked for awhile and I am posting from a mobile. I have a couple of movie scenes that are stuck in my head. I saw parts of this movie a few times on regular old t.v., when I was a kid, maybe 15, 20 years ago. No cable. I remember my dad watching it so it must have been a Saturday or Sunday thing. Anywho, to the movie. The main character had some things going on that she was seeing a therapist for.. it got pretty intense, so she went to the desert to get away from it, the stuff kept happening to her, crazy dreams and such and a man appearing with thunderstorms. She has someone start staying with her to keep her safe (cop- love interest). I remember a snake and teepee, and in one scene she is in a two story house with a balcony that has double doors. The love interest is sleeping down stairs I think. Cause they aren’t “a thing” yet. A storm brews up and the doors to the balcony bust open with a full storm in the background, the man is their on the balcony. Says that she is someone else, like she was reincarnated and use to be the love of his life and he came back for her.( I think) I have searched everywhere for this and asked multiple people, no one remembers it. Any help would be greatly appreciated! I am sorry for the rambling, just trying to remember all the details possible.",1,,,,

So as a small child I turned it off cos I didn't want to read subs. They lived next to a canyon I think? I do remember they were in the desert tho. Please tell me this wasn't a fever dream. I want to watch it in full now as an older person. This has been bothering me for years. Thanks for your time,2,thanks?,,,

783,8oi9o3,tipofmytongue,[TOMT] [Movie/Film] Psychological horror film about a woman who moves to a deserted beach-side shack following the murder of her family and ends up having a nervous breakdown.,78,8oi9o3,1,2018-06-04 17:42:33,Jorogumo1023,"Hey all, So a couple years ago, my mom went berserk and cancelled our DirecTV over the summer. Given that I live in the middle of nowhere, we were all pretty devastated (not to mention bored to tears). Luckily, our small town had one movie rental place (now closed), which became our lifeline. We got movies nearly everyday, our favorites part of the psychological horror genre -- you know, those ""mind fuck"" films that, after watching them, leave you wondering for days. At any rate, I brought home a movie one evening that started out kind of slow. The events seemed completely random, with characters making comments that seemed to make little to no sense. However, by the end, everything sort of came together in a way that was pretty impressive -- and all at once, those of us watching almost literally had that light bulb moment when everything made sense. Because it's been so long ago, the plot (which was disjointed and confusing to begin with) is a little fuzzy. To make matters worse, I'm the only person who remembers watching this film. It starts off with the main character (a young-ish woman, thin with blonde hair) and her sister going over to their mother's (and mother's boyfriend's) house for dinner. It cuts back to this scene multiple times over the course of the movie, but with the events playing out further along each time. By the end, it becomes clear that something terrible has happened, as there is blood everywhere. In between these returns to the beginning scene of the movie, the main character goes to a deserted, dilapidated shack by the beach, where she lives in solitude. As the movie progresses, her sister shows up at the shack, as does the mother's boyfriend. Like I said before, the interactions between the characters is very strange and doesn't seem to make any sense. The choices that the characters make are illogical, but by the end, it becomes clear that the main character has suffered some sort of break from reality as she comes to terms with what actually happened that night when she and her sister went to visit their mother for dinner. If this plot sounds familiar to anyone, please let me know. I can't remember the name of the movie, and I've tried Googling the plot (but that is understandably pretty difficult). As I mentioned, no one else remembers the movie, but I'm sure it's out there somewhere. Thanks in advance!",5,thanks?,,,

Your title immediately made me think of that movie, since the protagonist also flees to a beach-side house, where she has a nervous breakdown as well. Furthermore it's also a movie where everything falls in it's place in the end. I know it might be a bit of a stretch, since this movie was only published in Dutch as far as I know, but maybe there was a chance you saw it with English subtitles? This is the IMDB page by the way: https://www.imdb.com/title/tt1388411/. It's interesting that they call it 'The Dark House' on there, since that doesn't directly translate from the original title.

Or black and white. Can't remember any actors. There's one scene this detective is investigating a murder and keeps going back to one part of the pavement where this mob criminal got knocked and died. He also goes to a foreign lady's apartment to view the crime scene from her window and she keeps yelling at him in a language he doesn't understand. And somehow then it turns out the mob guy was still alive. And this detective wants to catch him. They do this chase in the shadows thing. It's shot at night and you never really get to see who the detective is chasing but the guy fleeing eventually loses him by stepping into a long circular construct in the middle of the street. When he steps out you realize the bad guy is alive. Eventually detective tracks him down to this abandoned carnival place and they negotiate on a ride at this empty park. Can't remember what happens after but it ends with a set up and the mob guy gets tipped off by his gf. But then the cop appeals to the gf at the train station and I can't remember again if she gives him up or helps the detective. I wish I could give much more info but I'm really sorry. My computer crashed and I lost all of these new movies that I only watched once so now these scenes come into my head and I can't place them to re-watch the film.

It’s set in a city and then there’s a caged off government facility in the sandy area and the father and his daughter go in and they get caught by the government who then explain everything to them about like dormant eggs and shit.

Its ""the end of the world"" and it looks like they are running out of food and supplies. They pass another family but dont say anything to eachother so you can tell everyones kinda just fending for themselves. About 20 min in, the dad discovers an abandoned half sunken boat near by and he goes in but he leaves real quick because he hears a weird noise.. He didnt warn his wife, and she goes in the boat to look for supplies while he is playing with the baby. Then she gets bit by something. I Dont think she makes it. Anyway thats where i left off but i remember the info said something about a father doing everything he can to protect his daughter during ""the apocalypse"" kinda scenario. I think the dad is kind of famous...just cant remember who he is. Hope someone can help me! Thanks in advance!",3,thanks?,,,

I'm not sure on the exact details here, but I recall that the film was littered with period-inappropriate wardrobe (especially in crowd shots) and visible tire tracks in the muddy dirt roads. There may have even been a truck visible in the background in one shot. - The film begins with a supernatural presence or demon or something making the children of the town sick and eventually killing them. There may have been a little girl who could see the demon or ghosts of other children or something. - About halfway through, the little girl dies and is taken to some afterlife place. I seem to recall someone telling her that her death was a mistake, but I might be mixing that up with something else. I think she is either sent back to earth, or returns unbeknownst to the afterlife folks. - At this point the film takes a sharp tonal shift, into the realm of action-adventure. - I seem to recall some beings from the afterlife (maybe three) are sent back to the world of the living. I think they were dressed in suits, but that could be a detail that I made up. They proceed to battle with and destroy the demon and save the little girl. - I think I remember someone saying that the film was the passion project of a well-known chef who put his career and personal finances on the line to make it. Please help!",3,,,,

The mechs had a somewhat believable design, fairly militaristic as opposed to Zords from Power Rangers or whatever, I believe each had designated colors. Red for the white guy is the only one I can remember though. I think they fought some Tremors-like alien worms but am not sure. The only scene I remember clearly is the mech team being trapped inside some ice tunnels and using their lasers or engine exhaust or something to melt their way out.

I think it might be an 80's maybe early 90's movie? A school gets taken over by some kind of militant group. The kids are all trapped but eventually they hatch a plan to get out. At some point I think they are crawling through the attic of the school and are using the faucets in the bathroom as some kind of signal. One of the militants goes to use the bathroom in the middle of their plan and all hell breaks loose. At one point one of the kids who had been in contact with his dad (the principal I think) is on route to be released through negotiation but tries to be a hero and ends up getting killed. That is all I remember from the movie. Not totally sure if those details are totally accurate. It's been a long time. Thanks.,1,thanks?,,,

This meant I rarely caught the titles of these movies, however I do remember quite a few things about this movie, despite seeing it over 10 years ago, as it was the first “scary” movie I saw and it scarred me. At the beginning there was some sort of robot or robotic suit, and after being struck by lightning or some other source of electricity, it came to life and started killing people in some sort of lab. I remember one scene where it loses most of its limbs, but then they all just come back together and it continues killing. It ended with a female protagonist somehow bringing it in contact with a large amount of water, where it got electrocuted and died. The only other thing I remember was that the movie was pretty gory, if that helps at all.

What he remembered of it was that it was a surreal, very trippy movie, which had some people living in a village inside of some sort of ""bubble"". The aesthetics of the village were greek-roman and everyone dressed very classically also. There was also some kind of giant floating head which was or reminded him of a roman or greek bust and had something to do with some crops, idk if he was picking them or asking for them or something. It felt very creepy and barren, in a sort of deserted landscape just like the paintings.

I gotta say that the score from that particular version was amazing, particularly in the scenes with the scenes taking place in “the present.” (The film takes place in several time periods.) The parts I remember pertain to specific scenes that were given yellow monochrome filters and regarded the main woman in the “present” and her lover.

The episodes were about 1-2 hours long(not sure), in color, they were all about sci-fi themes and had a twilight zone kind of vibe to them (might have actually been twilight zone but which episodes?). I'm almost sure the language was English, at most french (I saw it dubbed). The episodes were not related between them and were meant to be independent stories. I only saw 2 and here is what I remember. First episode plot: 2-3 students investigate a man(possibly scientist) who is either missing or is a campus urban legend. I remember very clearly a scene when one of them sees a poster of a hummingbird in flight and has an epiphany when he sees that the bird's wings become invisible because they are moving very fast. They figure out that the man they are looking for has somehow(possibly through the use of a potion/serum) entered a plane of reality where everything exists so fast that it becomes invisible. In another scene they are able to briefly experience this effect themselves, I remember how they are walking and everything around them is stopped in time. One of them picks up a ball and throws it and it just froze in the air. By the end they are able to find and see the man they were looking for, he is old with long white hair, the accelerated existence made him live his entire life in a few days and he is near death. Second Episode: I only saw a bit, it was about a middle aged woman who somehow came into possession of a strange stone, about the size of an ostrich egg, it was suggested that there is something paranormal about this stone. I remember a scene when an acquaintance of this woman (a doctor/chemist/scientist), while visiting her, notices the stone and asks if he can scrape a bit off to take to his lab and investigate it under a microscope. That's it. Please help me find the name of the show and specifically these episodes or at least the first one.",1,,,,

It's about a patrol that gets ambushed and whittled down to a few survivors who must find a way back to their base. I remember that the last scene was of two soldiers who are chased and reach the edge of a forest. To reach safety, they must cross the last few hundred meters in the open and under fire from enemy soldiers who are on their tails. They do so by running in a zigzag pattern and I think only one of them survives and he praises the other guy who didn't survive.",1,,,,

The girl went to run upstairs only to realize there was another person up there wearing the same pointy hooded cloak and mask as the person chasing her. She freaked out and turned to run downstairs but the first person chasing her was at the bottom of the stairs.

The youngest kid, has a crush on his school and one day they accidentally slept side-by-side during their gym class while holding hands. Their classmates teased that the girl was gonna be pregnant since they ""slept"" together so, being kids, they believed it and they were very worried how they were gonna tell their parents. (it was really funny). The teenage older brother always flunked school and is kind of a delinquent. I remembered a scene where he received a lot of scolding from his grandma and words literally came out of the grandma's mouth into his ear and came out the other ear. It was a very funny scene. I don't remember the other story arcs of the family.

This is a movie I watched couple of years ago that I can't find anywhere. So, I think it was the first day of our guy in his new work, so he goes to a big building. He and some people are locked in a floor (I think below the ground level) and the only way that they can exit is using the elevator. Either some other people wearing suits or themselves starts to kill the people in there. I'm not entirely sure but there may be a bomb involved. I remember the ending, our guy and a girl gets in the elevator and they start to kiss and the door closes. While the door closes we see our guy is holding a sword, which off screen kills the girl. Apparently our guy was involved in this thing. He gets in a limo and there is this woman (red haired?) and he talks with her, which I assume is the person behind all of this. I hope you know which movie I'm talking about. Thanks.",1,thanks?,,,

I'm almost certain it was to put dynamite into crevices so the cliff could be destroyed. Perhaps this lowering of the basket was done many times with the workers but the last time they were sent down (maybe to light the fuse) they got stuck as the basket was being pulled up. The basket had some size and could probably fit 5+ people. I think the dynamite exploded before they could be pulled up and I don't know if anyone survived. I want to say the workers were ethnic while the people running the operation were white (maybe settlers/colonists). Could've been during a gold rush or frontier phase. The scene was likely in a desert. Maybe this was set in the southern USA/Mexico/Central America in the late 1800s/early 1900s. Dynamite was invented in 1867 so if the movie was historically accurate this would make sense. Any ideas?,1,,,,

He softly sings ""I think we're along now,"" as he approaches the girl, and then tries to sort of ""make friends."" Toward the end of the movie, the family is on a boat on a river at night.

Looked like it was made in the 90s?, kinda cheap (maybe direct to video/TV movie?); Was violent and scary to my 10 year old brain but was actually probably pretty cheesy. Plot points: I remember it taking place in a haunted or booby-trapped mansion of some kind. All these people are there to attend a party (?), I think a costume party. One woman is dressed like Cleopatra and ends up dying by being trapped in a loom, and the threads start going through her skin. Another person is killed by a clock where every time the clock strikes the hour a guillotine blade or axe comes down inside the clock (someone gets their head stuck in there at the wrong time and dies). There may have also been a time limit until the doors to the house could open so they had to spend 12 hours in there and live or something (but now it sounds like I'm describing House on Haunted Hill so I dunno). Previous suggestions: The Abominable Dr. Phibes -- couldn't find anything about anyone dressed as Cleopatra or death by loom in it, so I don't think that's it. House on Haunted Hill 1959 -- This movie is in black and white, what I saw was def in color, and not that old. Everyone had 80s or 90s makeup in what I saw. It's not the 1999 HOHH movie either.

It starts raining and only he has an umbrella. He grabs her hand and runs home with her, but because of the rain her previously soapy hands begin to bubble up all over the place like an overloaded dishwasher while he's still holding her hand.

Outside the window are these evil flying orb-shaped monsters, grinning and snarling.

All I know is that the movie has a scene where a girl is going into an audition. Not sure if it’s for acting or modeling, but the girl auditioning is initially hopeful and happy and ready for her big break. But then the audition takes a dark turn real quick when the male “casting agents” start asking her to take her clothes off, going on this big wrap about how you have to get naked to be taken seriously or something. Basically pressuring her to take her top off to get into the industry. Pretty sure the scene ends with her in tears taking her clothes off.

2034,8pcgqu,tipofmytongue,"[TOMT][Movie] A movie about an outbreak of a disease/virus on possibly an otherwise idyllic tropical island where they have to search for a guy who is either immune or has had the disease and recovered, unlike everyone else.",7,8pcgqu,1,2018-06-07 19:58:03,BeautyAndTheDekes,"So I’ve been looking for this one for a looong time through lots of fruitless Google searches. I remember watching this on Cable as a kid, so it’s probably a late 80’s or 90’s movie, though I’m not 100% sure about that. I remember very little about it so I must have been pretty young when I watched it. So I’m pretty sure that it was based on like a nice sunny island that would be like Barbados or something. I think the main character was a woman similar to Helen Hunt in Twister but I could be wrong. The basic plot is that there is a disease on the island (possibly like flu, smallpox or ebola) that is killing everyone and turning everyone crazy with fear etc. I think the main character drives the film by trying to find some cure, and she finds that one big guy is immune or has had the disease and has recovered, which is unheard of. She then convinced him after much coaxing to take some of his blood. That’s about as much detail as I remember other than a scene where one guy is giving a speech on his death bed and it’s in a basic hospital with iron bedframe and striped sheets. It’s definitely not Outbreak (but that is a great film), or anything fairly new like Contagion. I realise this is pretty vague but any suggestions would be great…I’ve been trying to think of this for the last couple of years. Thanks!",1,thanks?,,,

The main (female) lead wears a striped suit that's black and white for most of the movie. Near the end, she hurts her ankle or something and people (or creatures) of different colors come together to help her, which ends up bringing the rainbow color back to her suit (and maybe the world?).

One of their sisters has been captured by some sort of bad guys for reasons I don't remember. The climax is them fighting through what I recall was some sort of disused industrial complex. At some port during this, they come across a large array of various machine guns and accessories, and there's a scene with them assembling laser sights and extended mags and whatnot into ridiculous customized machine guns which they then use for the remainder of the third act. It ends up with them rescuing the sister, who then ends up kissing the guy that isn't her brother. The end is the three of them standing there, covered in sweat and blood and whatnot, the guy with the sister on his arm turns to his friend and says something along the lines of, ""And I learned to date your sister.""",2,,,,

I hope I've followed all the rules for this sub. This has been bothering me for a looong time and my dad told me he had no idea what I'm talking about. I had this movie on VHS and it was around the early 2000s, no later that 2003 or so, but the animation could have easily been from the 80 or 90s. I've looked on cartoon film archives and I've found nothing. There was this little girl who had blonde hair and I think a white unicorn or a horse (not ""The Last Unicorn"") and she would magically teleport wherever there was a sad child, and she would make them happy again. There was a town that was upset because of an evil witch (I think) and she teleported there to help them. I remember at the end she somehow was made unconscious and this little boy cried and it magically resuscitated her. Does anyone have any idea what this movie was? I loved it so much when I was younger but I really just have no clue what it was called. Any help would be so awesome!!",1,,,,

Not a huge budget film; not a blockbuster hit. It did have at least one relatively high-profile actor in the cast. It's a crime movie following a really low-level criminal, our protagonist, who is wronged somehow--double-crossed in a deal that shorts him a minor amount of money, something like that. He is **furious** about this. He is going to set things right, no matter what it costs him. As he pursues his particular sense of justice, his opponents put up all kinds of obstacles, beat him down, etc., but he will not be stopped, and they're incredulous because he's going to so much effort over such a minor offense. By the end of things, the organization is little more than flaming wreckage, but he finally gets back what he felt he was owed. This is such a generic description that I feel almost certain that multiple movies match this description, but I have a vivid memory of some mid-level thug just who just cannot believe that this guy is still causing trouble after everything they've put him through--yet I cannot put a name or face to any of these characters.",3,,,,

The boogeyman will hide again.” “When you see him count to 8 (I forget this part)” “When you see him count to 5 [the song slows down] you better pray you stay alive” I think after that the door bursts open or something?

Sometimes there is a woman on a bench, waiting for the bus and he falls in love with her. He eventually makes the final decision of grabbing a flower and rushing into her world through the billboard. Before he reaches her, the billboard from which he emerged is covered by a new advertisement and he vanishes on the spot. She does however find the flower he was holding on the ground.

It was an older movie/show and all I remember is that there was a period piece (like Tom Sawyer's time) and these kids found this fort that was empty. Anyway they were playing in it and these soldiers/pirates or whatever found the fort and thought it was occupied by an army. The kids defended their fort Home Alone style. All i really remember is them tying a bunch of old guns with bayonets to a piece of wood evenly spaced out and marched it around the fort walls so from the outside it looks like a group of soldiers with guns marching rather than just a bunch of kids.

He meets a girl and falls in love with her and through some turn of events she starts carrying out all the hits and mob stuff he's supposed to do. I only remember a few scenes from it, in the opening scene the main character and another hit man smash a painting over a guy's head, another scene near the end that was part of a montage where the love interest is making food in her kitchen but also cleaning or doing something with her gun, and there was a line from the main character that was kind of a running joke through the movie, ""We're not the mafia, we're Irish"", or something like that.

I watched a movie on Hulu a couple months back that followed an alcoholic man after he quit his job and became a writer(although there was less writing and more drinking). Recently renewed my Hulu subscription, but sadly I can’t remember the title. I only remember a couple of parts of the movie clearly. In one part, he finds work at a newspaper as a janitor(not the writing position he applied for). After one day of work, he is fired but still expects a paycheck so he can go get drunk, and a higher-up at the newspaper gives him the money because he is also an alcoholic and feels bad. In another scene, he goes to an unemployment office(or someplace similar, most people are guaranteed a job there if I recall correctly) and he’s thrown out for drinking inside. After he’s thrown out, he shares a drink on the sidewalk with a fellow homeless dude. That’s all I remember about it, any help is appreciated.",1,,,,

I'd like to watch it again but I can't remember what it is. I'll do my best to describe it: In the beginning there's a scene where two small opposing forces fight, I'd say fewer than 10 people on each side. The protagonists get absolutely slaughtered. Fighting with spears and fly/jumping around and stuff. I remember unusual weapons and tons of blood. There's definitely some water. I'm pretty sure one of the bad guys attacked by coming up out of the water. Next, the remaining protagonists go through training to confront the antagonists again. It seems like there is no hope ... But in the third act, the protagonists take on the antagonists again, and prevail! Hurrah. I recognize this is probably the plot of many samurai ninjas. I think this one was in color and I want to say it was samurais VS ninjas, but as you can tell my memory isn't great. I'll gladly watch any suggestions to see if that was it.

Anyways - I am having that with a documentary I watched a few years ago, and it is gnawing at me (which is ironic considering I am watching a Buddha documentary, ha!). The best description my exhausted Friday night mind can express: I want to say it was on Netflix somewhere between 2013-2016, but it could have also been featured on PBS, BBC, or another network in that vain. It was a silent (although there may have been music), or minimal minimal speaking, documentary with intense videography and ability to capture culture, beauty, and essence with just a videocamera. It was at least very good quality video, with seemingly perfect lighting - I am thinking of scenes in India or China and its parts with factories (sweat shot types), to maybe scenes of folks in the US and the extravagance of NYC - perhaps not those exact scenes, but scenes that evoke that sort of mood.

So, I remember a movie I saw as a kid, where this really weird little town has this crazy cube thing show up and do all this weird stuff. All the details about the movie I remember are these: one of the main characters’ parents both work at the same place, and eventually the boss fires one of the parents, meaning they would have to move, while the other stays employed, so there’s a whole problem over what to do. Towards the end, this baby touches the cube and becomes super smart with the ability to talk, and is the one that decides to send the cube away forever. And if I am remembering correctly, there may be a scene where a kid turns a bully’s head into an alligator head? That one is up in the air for me. Now the problem is I’ve looked everywhere for this and found nothing, which leads me to believe that I just made this up when I was younger, but I swear to god I’ve seen it.

The time frame I am certain on as it was between my first and second deployment. The trailer was seen on youtube if that helps at all and I believe that it was a foreign film (not positive) possibly British. Plot: A young girl around the age of 10 has stolen something of value from what is essentially the devil and needs to escape the reality she is in to get back home. The antagonist sends ""demons"" to track her down and retrieve whatever it was she took. There is a teenage boy who is helping her escape and only has one arm. Scenes: The boy is running with the girl through a housing development being chased by a mindless horde and a fight ensues in the middle of a cul de sac. The one armed boy is using a sword or walking stick. The horde was looked like normal people if I remember correctly. A female ""demon"" is moving through a house. There is either a towel wrapped around her hair or she had an abnormally shaped head. She touches a wall and a black decay started the spread from her fingers. At one point in the trailer the same figure lets opens her mouth and the unhinges naturally wide; I seem to remember she was screaming. The girl is standing in front of the devil figure who in the scene looks completely human and he is demanding she return what she stole. The surrounding is a large dark room or warehouse. I don't know if the movie ever actually released but I have been trying to find it or the trailer for the last 10 years. Any help is greatly appreciated. Thanks in advance.",2,thanks?,,,

The next scene is vague but its of two men fighting in a sort of courtyard over some sort of black purse looking object which if i remember correctly has treasure or a necklace in it, the fight scene is mainly of the two men not letting go of this object while fighting. the last scene i remember is of a man dying in a room that has red carpet and is surrounded by stands with Armour he dies in another mans arms and this is the end of the movie.",1,,,,

(probably my first time encountering the concept of suicide) 2: I think he got involved with bullies and/or drug dealers. I remember someone holding a plastic sheet/baggie with white sticks in it. My parents avoided explaining that to me. Possibly a bag of joints. 3: They went into a camera store, while one guy talked to the sales person another stole a camera. 4: Riding in a car, someone shouted out the window to a girl/hooker something along the lines of ""Hey! How much for a blowjob?"" (this time my dad was eager to explain to me what a blowjob was, and i was still young enough to be disgusted by the idea. hahaha) Well, i hope that any of that rings a bell with someone.

The plot of the movie involves this guy, playing a missionary, falling in love with a local girl. The actress playing his love interest was completely awful according to him. I don't remember what happens after that. The segment is introduced by this guy's cousin, and I wanted to find it because he said something in the beginning along the lines of, ""my cousin is the sort of guy who things just \*happen\* to,"" which I really liked.

Tim Currys first role was in 1968. He would have only been 17 at the release of My Fair Lady - which doesn't rule him out completely but he was only doing TV stuff in the UK until Rocky Horror. His IMDB page doesn't have any mention of My Fair Lady or Pygmalion. So I think you have probably just got mixed up with Clue or Annie.,1,,,,

It could have been a very spacious wooden shed also. I remember just one specific part of the movie, maybe just one shot from it. It's not a movie I watched, but I remember walking in the living room where my sister was watching it on the tv. It's bugged me for a while what that movie was. I thought it was maybe Beetlejuice, and while some parts of that movie fit, when I watched Beetlejuice for the first time recently, I didn't have any ""That's it!"" moment. Some of this may be inaccurate, it was a while ago. There are a bunch of oddly dressed, makeup covered people there. They're monsters, or ghosts or something of the sort (I think monsters), but friendly. Some are floating it the air, or maybe sitting up on a balcony. They're possibly dressed sort of like bums. With them are kids (possibly adults, but I don't think so). Two of them. One girl and one boy, with blonde or brown hair. It was a comedy/family movie, one or the other or both, but probably both. It looked like a 80's or 90's movie. I really don't think, based on the picture quality, that it was from the 2000's onward. If I had to guess, I would say it was from the 80's.

First movie is about a prison movie. I remember one of the scenes where the african american guy was being abused by his white inmate who happens to be in the same room as him until he couldn't take it anymore. I think he made a shank out of a toothbrush one time. Then theres like a choir show(?) he slowly walked forward while looking at his abuser and then he started stabbing him. The ending is where the riot occurs in prison. The main character was standing in front of the guy(i think his friend) where hes aking him to give him a hug or something. But the guards are telling him to put down his weapon. Before he approach the main character, he got shot by one of the guards. Thats all i can remember from this movie. Second movie is a bit vague from my memory. All i remember its Rated-R vampire movie. One of the scene i remember is one of the lady vampire villain made out with one of her henchmen for punishment and then a few moments later he started inflating like a baloon and then popped. I remember the main character is a woman and she fell in love with the vampire male lead and in the end she became a vampire too(?). Thanks.",1,thanks?,,,

In addition, the two dudes spoke in english, while the rest in the prison /police station scene spoke in a different language. Weirdly enough, the subtitles were not at the bottom, but at the side of screen, with different colors. Unfortunately that's all I remember. I'm also sure that it's a recent film, because I saw it in HD. Can anyone help? Edit: I'm quite positive that it's a prison, as a prisoner behind bars said to them something like ""forgot about me?

Then a man comes in. I think it was someone she trusted, but he's actually evil and he tries to kidnap her. or tell her to not go through the dance. i don't know. and at that moment, her boyfriend comes in to fight the man but the man stabs him in the stomach and he's hunched over and the girl is crying. i think the boyfriend may have died? and that's where i forget the rest. i can't trust my 7-8 year old memory but it's worth a shot, so thank you!",1,thanks?,,,

There was a girl who ran into a (dark wooden) house because she was being chased by a person in a black cloak with a pointed hood who was also wearing a scary witch looking mask and holding a knife. The girl went to run upstairs only to realize there was another person up there wearing the same pointy hooded cloak and mask as the person chasing her. She freaked out and turned to run downstairs but the first person chasing her was at the bottom of the stairs. Then, (if I remember correctly) the two cloaked people took her outside, removed their masks (and I believe it was two guys her age that she knew), and they killed her by burning her at a stake or something like that. *NOTE: Not Scream or The Village",2,,,,

3294,8pyvfe,tipofmytongue,[TOMT] [Film] A film about two people on vacation being chased by a group of children,8,8pyvfe,1,2018-06-10 07:39:17,Lord-doomshower,"It was an old black and white film, an adaptation after a play with the same name. It was about this woman, I forgot her name, who was committed to a psychiatric ward by an elder relative of her after a traumatic event while in vacation in Europe with her cousin or brother. Everyone thinks this woman is insane, except her doctor who wants to find the source of her troubles. The doctor brings her to the house of her relative, (who, by the way, has a huge, luxurious, jungle-like garden) where she is asked to retell the events. So, she and this guy were in vacation in Spain, they spent their days going to the beach, etc. Then, one day, this guy starts being seen around some children. (Also, I remember that everything appeared very white on film: the sunstroken beach, the streets, the walls of the buildings; it created a very nauseatic feeling). Soon, the guy says that they need to leave and he seems terrified after seeing those children near the hotel. I don't remember what happens next, but the finale of the movie is nuts. Basically, there is this large chase scene, the guy is chased up the streets of the city by more and more children who seem to pour from everywhere, while the woman is following behind them. But the movie really screws with your mind and things seem to change depending of who is in the shot. For example, the guy runs past a skeleton, but when the woman gets there, it is replaced by a beggar. The children corner the man on top of a hill and (I'm not too sure about this one) they attack him, kill him and eat him, while she watches in horror. The movie ends returning to the present, with the elder relative holding the doctor's arm as they both walk into the garden.",2,,,,

The movie is framed by the pregnant girl telling the story of a small cartoon girl who is defeated by life, which she draws and makes into an animation short, and the cartoon girl is supposed to be her miscarried daughter, and it ends in the tall red haired one apparently committing suicide by jumping off a building but she’s caught by a huge pillow (I still don’t get this part) That’s all I remember, I cant even remember the country but I think it was Northern European?

So, my father has seen a movie but can't remember the title, and everything he looked for point out to ""Take Shelter"" but it isn't that. The pitch would be a married couple with some kids (maybe just one), and the husband changes his social status (probably a job loss), goes a bit crazy from here on and, at some point in the movie, he starts digging holes in his garden, looking for something. His wife would go away with the children, would come back to check on him once, and that's basically all he can remember. Can't even remember the ending, but apparently it isn't a happy one. If you have any idea of what this film could be, my father and I would be very grateful ! He's been looking for it for some months now, but not being able to speak proper English makes it so that the Reddit potential has still be untouched. Thanks in advance if you have any info !",1,thanks?,,,

The only scene I can remember from it, though, involved a mother, her son (a slightly heavier child) and a larger built and intimidating man who may or may not be a step-father to the boy. From what I can recall, the scene starts in a house where they are all sitting at a table having a meal that the mother cooked. The room is quiet and tense until one of them makes a joke. The man laughs at it, and the boy (who seems nervous as hell about the guy) starts laughing as well. Then, the man abruptly stops laughing and looks angry. This is where things start to get fuzzy for me and I can't exactly remember what happens next except that the mother and her son start running away. They get into the mother's car and start flying down a two lane road with trees on either side. The man is in his own vehicle (maybe a big truck) and chases them down the road. He eventually catches up and run them either into oncoming traffic or off the road. The final shot I can remember is the camera panning across the wreckage and showing the bodies of the mother and child. I'm know it's not the best description of a scene, but I really hope someone can help me out. Thank you in advance!",1,thanks?,,,

I remember the opening scene had the main girl playing with sock puppets, and one attacks another with a marker whilst yelling ""THE BLACK MAGIC MARKER!"" After getting sucked into a fantasy or sci-fi world, she meets a dude who wears a masquerade mask all the time. He accompanies her for the rest of the film, possibly acting as some comedic support character(maybe love interest?). I swear I also remember them encountering some weird bird people who don't talk; one of them saves her and mask guy. Mask betrays her near the climax of the film, and I vaguely recall her being forced to wear a dress while crying? I also believe the ""traitor revealed"" scene was framed where masky was standing in a spotlight with his back turned, and does a dramatic 180 to face the main character. The film had some weird creatures and animals in it, and I think they may have been mostly CGI, as opposed to practical fx.

I'm looking for an old anime film but i can't find it anywhere. As far as i can remember, The film follows a spaceship crew of an all\-women race at war with an alien race that may or may not be made of robots. The main thing seems to be these aliens are masculine only in nature. The Women's ship has 2 small robots that aid in pretty much everything, one is blue, the other may be red or white, i can't remember. At some point in the middle of the film, one of the women gets impregnated with a child who grows at an advanced rate into what's supposed to be the first ""man"". They end up in what appears to be our solar system (post\-humanity) and their final fight occurs on the moon, however the moon is covered in lush forest and there are strange alien towers scattered in a grid over the surface. When these towers are activated they seem to terraform the earth and reduce the moon to it's current appearance. The last thing i remember from the ending (I might be thinking of a different film though) is it showing this man and the last surviving member of the female crew falling to earth and seeding humanity. Any takers? I remember watching it when i was a kid in either the late 80's or early 90's but it could have been old by that time anyways.",1,,,,

Okay, so in addition to the title, I'm pretty sure one of the animals is a frog or a toad. And I think they've got some sort of contraption which they use to effect a rescue of another character in the factory type building. I think there's a broken window involved. It might be raining because I'm fairly sure there's mud. This is probably near the end of the film. I think the contraption is worn on your back. There's a slight possibility that I'm confused about the animals thing but I don't think so; I feel like the building is big relative to them. I'm not sure how old this movie is. It's traditionally animated and isn't a Wind in the Willows adaptation. I don't know where it was made but there's definitely an English language version out there and I really have no idea if that's the original version or a dub. I don't recall what kind of accents were used. I feel like it's probably older than 1995 because I don't remember the animation feeling that crisp or fluid. It could plausibly be released up until 2000 or so, though, as we'd get it out in the early 2000s. Definitely hand drawn though. Sorry I don't remember any more.",1,,,,

I think the movie was from the mid 70s-early80s. It started out with a larger fellow with a big 70s mustache fucking a girl in a cemetary. The girl stabs him with a dagger midintercourse if I correctly remember. A later scene was a funeral of the kid's parents. He watched from a distance on a dirtbike a man that lifted his parents caskets inside of the funeral home. He later goes to explore the funeral home. He enters through the basement then is attacked by small men who the kid stabs and the small man bleeds yellow. At this point the kid runs off back home.

It might’ve also been nominated or won an Oscar, but I can’t remember. I asked my mom about it today, and she also can’t remember the film. It was a modern film, and came out not long before my family watched it. At the start of the film, I believe it was showing clips of the couple’s daily lives before the woman died, with the old man narrating over it. I remember one clip pretty clearly where the old man was in the bathroom, went to put some toothpaste on his toothbrush, and then missed his brush, dropping the toothpaste on the floor. He then bends down and scoops up the toothpaste with his toothbrush, and proceeds to brush his teeth. He did all this while his narration stated how his wife always kept the bathroom spotless and germ free. I remember also that the cinematography and direction was candid, and often unflattering to the couple, and I think the old man was later joined by other characters and the film moved from there.

She likes the freedom at first but soon realizes that they are disgusting slobs and she is doing everything for them.(I don’t remember the rest) One where I can only remember a quote from it which is “I want to be a boy toy” in some weird accent Another in which a kid sends their little brother to some camp where he grows vegetables or something In between each film there would be a little girl dressed up in business attire that would give comments about the film and would introduce the next. I also think she would say who each film was by.,2,,,,

I remember watching it late at night when I was a kid in the late 90’s/early-mid00’s (sorry, I’m bad with timelines) on SBS. It is not filmed in English, I’m thinking it was German or Russian but there is no way for me to verify that. It starts off with a group of friends going on some sort of holiday. They are camping near a little river and one of the friends falls asleep. As a joke they zip him up in his sleeping bag and throw him in the water (to the protests of one of the friends who I’ll call Friend A) and are laughing until he doesn’t come up. After discovering they’ve accidentally killed him, they are all pretty shocked. They make a pact to not tell anyone what happened and Friend A reluctantly agrees. I think they may have been in some sort of car crash on their way back home. When they get home, they try to act like everything is normal but creepy and scary things start happening to them. One girl is walking through an underground train station and realises she is the only one there, then hears a bunch of dogs in the distance, tries to find an exit but they are all locked and presumably gets mauled to death by the dogs. I can’t remember what happens to the rest of them but pretty sure all except Friend A get brutally murdered. Friend A ends up waking up from a coma (which I guess all of them were in) and somehow turns out that the dead Friend was killing them all off in the coma for killing him, but spared Friend A because he tried to rescue him or something. That’s really as much detail as I can remember and I have posted this a couple of times but I really hope someone can help me. Thank you!

I saw this old cartoon when I was a kid, it was in french but it was silent, I think. The main idea was that all these different children were trying to find something (from what I remember, I think it was the sun?) Some bad guy had the sun in a briefcase or something and these kids went to all these different spots to find him. One particular scene was in a green forest and an area w lots of snow). The style I think, was sort of stop motion-y? But I think it was drawn. There was a main character, a blonde girl that led the other children. It wasnt in a traditional animation style, it didnt flow - it was more chopped if that makes sense. It wasnt like a series, I think it was a proper film but it was probably very short.

Then she goes to ""college/high school"" and talks to her friends about a concert (I think it was a rock concert), and they all go to that concert. I don't know why, they end up in a house in the middle of nowhere and the owner of the house tries to kill all of them. The house is empty at first, but then the owner arrives and starts to kill everyone. Things I think I remember: There are four friends in the house, two of them are a couple (a blonde girl and a guy). The last two are the woman in white top and anoher guy, they end up having sex in some sort of stable in the house. (Is not explicit, they just kiss, she takes off her top -she has a black bra- they kiss, and the scene ends) The killer has loooong hair like Slash but it covers his face.

Later on what I remember is they all drive to a beach house with their professor, and then they all went to the beach first &amp; he sees the girl he video chated with and recognized her by her tattoo on the video chat. The main character, one of these friends, has an ill brother,(also he wears glasses) drug addict that has a homeless looking friend, and perhaps he's imaginary as far as I remember. The mentally ill drug addict brother comes up to the beach house and the main character-his brother asks him to leave and not to cause any problems. (he's kinda ashamed of him). But he didn't leave, he started sneaking on them. One couple from this group of friends start making out in the beach house garage and the ill brother morbidly kills them both, I don't remember how. Also there are a lot of scenes with animated monkey i think, he talks with him, and that's the ill brother's imagination due to drug use. He started killing all of them one by one and the main character, his normal brother notices this and everyone was scared etc etc and he drugged them all by pouring the drug into their drink and they didn't notice it because he was very sneaky in the entire movie. I remember in the end professor that was with them tripped out at the beach, it was night and he saw indigenous people around him as hallucination and drowned himself in the sea because of it. In the end, this main character, the normal brother, runs with a girl in some kind of greenhouse but the mentally ill drug addict brother manages to find them and kills the girl as far as I remember.

I say motel because it was pretty gaudy with it's colors. Could have been a 70s house though. He stands up from the bed and turns around and has this box strapped to his back. It's pretty small. Maybe 4 inches square. It's beeping with 2 red/green LEDs Its attached to him via a strap thats either in an X\-shape like the back of suspenders or straight down 2 backpack straps. We see his back facing the camera as he puts his shirt on. She says something along the lines of ""You know I hate that thing"" and he responds something like ""You know I have to wear it"" A moment or so later, he collapses and with either really bad special effects or stop\-motion, hes' suddenly wrapped in orange bandages from head to toe like a cocoon or mummy. He isn't dead...just preserved for something. I believe he had a heart condition. Anyway shes on her knees on the bed but sits up and screams in terror. It's as if the box contained the bandages.

However the effects wore off and the person that was burnt to a crisp and autopsied changed back to his normal uncrispy self but was still dead as a result of the autopsy. It was told from the perspective of an investigation as it was happening and it was decided to cover it up.

I met my best friend back in middle school and we discovered a mutual love of martial arts. He was a Wushu Kung Fu champion and had a ton of old Kung Fu movies he had bought in Canada. Info: This was a low budget Chinese martial arts film, probably made in the 80s or 90s. It was purchased on VHS in Montreal's China Town in the early 2000s. I am fairly certain it was dubbed, but it may have been have been subtitled. In the movie, there is a character who has a weapon that consists of a pike-like staff, with these spring loaded talons on the end. In the movie, when something touches the end of the staff, the talons close in and grab around the end of the staff. In one fight scene of the movie, the character loses possession of the staff and it falls on the ground. The character, unarmed, continues the battle but is eventually kicked or thrown on the ground and slides into the staff, head first. Before finally succumbing to their injuries, the character looks at the camera and says ""Ahh, killed by me own claw!"" It isn't gory at all, and is actually kinda funny. Although I'm not sure if it was supposed to be comical. Other details as I remember them: 1. the battle with the famous quote took place on a beach, or on sand The quote became a meme for a couple of my friends, and it has since spread to more friends and my wife, who have never seen it. I'd really like to show them the movie, or even just that clip. I'm going to draw some sketches of what I remember all this looking like. Thank you for your help!",1,thanks?,,,

The movie started at a party (I think it was a pool party) and a girl goes into a bedroom to read and a guy followed her in there and tried to sleep with her but another guy interrupted and helped her. I think it was a comedy (maybe like late 90s/early 2000s) That’s all I remember because i never finished the movie so not much help but any possible suggestions of what it could be is appreciated.,1,,,,

Can't link to it now because it's not in English. One of the rituals described was that which takes place annually at the Saut d'Eau waterfall in Haiti. According to the article, July every year this place gathers Haitians and ""voodoo sorcerers"" (quoting article here...) from all around the world for the purpose of honoring the local ""Goddess of Love"". The ritual features naked people gyrating, smearing themselves with a mixture of mud and the blood of sacrificed animals, and of course, engaging in massive orgies. So that's what the article says. Now, reading this definitely jogged a memory of mine of seeing a movie that contains a scene which very, very similarly depicts just such a ritual. Not sure if it's the exact same ""Haitian"" ritual, but pretty much every other detail matches. Saw the movie around 2000 or 2001. The exact setting was a moonlit small rocky lagoon and pretty much every detail quoted from the article matched. Again, not sure if the movie depicted this *exact* mating ritual as the article's, but it looked similar enough. Don't remember not a single other thing from the film. Any help?",1,,,,

I'm not sure at this point if I was imagining the events of the movie or not. I think the disc might have been broken or something since the movie seemed to go through a chapter and restart from the beginning. It might have been the preview and I did not realize it. This is a possibility. Here are the things that I remember * At the beginning of the movie, there is a shot of a hallway that is very tall. The hallway might be made of stone or metal. A boy and a girl walk down it presumably. Sort of at an angled view I think. They might have been brother and sister. That's what they're relationship felt like. *Then I remember that they find a little girl who might be a princess. *They take her away, but the grandmother of the little girl appears in sort of a robot suit later in their journey when they are at a swamp. My friends believe that the movie was Castle in the Sky, since a lot of that movie is similar to what I have described. But I still feel unconvinced. Maybe it was Castle in the Sky and as a kid I just imagined stuff, but I still want to see if there might have been something else.",1,,,,

I can't remember the premise at all but I think the environment, at least at one point during it, was a castle in ruins in a dense forest with tall deciduous trees around midday. I also think Hello Kitty was the main character, and if not I think at least the characters were anthropomorphic animals. If I remember correctly the art style was anime-esque with water color sort of backgrounds and all that. At some point, Hello Kitty, or whoever it is, is wandering the castle out of curiosity or perhaps in search of something. I apologize for the lack of details but it's all I have.

I was probably around 4 when I saw this which would make it 1993ish and it was in England.

It's something similar though, like Cruel Intensions. I hope someone knows what I'm talking about! Thanks.",3,thanks?,,,

I remember two specific scenes, however this could be 2 different old movies. It is not something too popular or mainstream. I am unable to find anything fitting in vampire movie databases. The setting is late 1880s- early 1900s. Scene 1: Vampire kid brats and their vampire nanny, dressed in typical Victorian maid dress. The brats trick nanny to go outside and lock the door, then when the sun rises in the morning the nanny turns into ashes. Scene 2: The people arrive at the castle and the owner and his sister are both vampires. She is a redhead with a perculiar fascinator on her head, shaped like a black web.

In it was a scene, in which a younger white man with some sort of buzz cut was standing in the door of some dark bathroom and the camera was looking at him through a mirror (so the man was actually standing behind the camera). Then (I think) the man died or maybe the ending was ambiguous. I always thought they were talking about Trainspotting, that’s what I remember. I quit the video abruptly, because the ending seemed cool and I did not want to spoil Trainspotting any further. The thing is I just watched Trainspotting and it’s not the movie from the video. So my question is now, do you maybe have an idea what movie was actually talked about in the video? I tried finding the video again, but I couldn’t. I also tried googling of course, but all that popped up was the movie “Mirrors”. I know I can’t provide a detailed description but I hope someone can help me nevertheless. Thanks in advance!",1,thanks?,,,

From what I can remember it had a late very late 90s early 00s vibe to it and may have been being shown on nickelodeon or some other kids/early teens channel. The film revolves around a group of friends who seem to come across this item that when holding it you can make wishes. in one scene the characters are in a cave (perhaps where they first found it) and the guy wishes for a twinkie and is all of a sudden encapsulated in one massive twinkie.

It turns out to be a hallucination, because the other patrons don't see the monster. The man is terrified and tries desperately to keep the little monster away from him. But all of a sudden, it disappears right in front of him. The man looks down and sees that the roast duck/chicken is back to normal. I'm not sure if it's a horror movie, but it sure looks like it.

I'm pretty sure it's a korean drama film. It's about some boy who is trying to find his mother and encounters a male adult along the way. The movie is entirely about the both of these two characters and how they try and get by. It's a pretty heartwarming film because it's mostly both of them walking around on the road and doing stuff. I recall a couple of scenes. There's a scene where they both go to a small theme park area and end up sleeping there. The older korean guy gets beat up, don't exactly remember why, but I think it was to protect the kid. There's also another scene where the kid actually finds his mother, but they don't meet because he see that his mother has moved on and has new children and husband or w/e. The guy who's been trying to take care of the kid sees this and tries to cheer him up. There's also another scene where they do some funny shit and sabotage a car driving on the road so they could hitch a ride or something, idk. Anyone know what I'm talking about?",2,,,,

I only remember one scene but it’s pretty specific. This guy comes to a restaurant and we see the kitchen, which is full of cockroaches but the people who worked there seemed kind of oblivious to that. I feel like the guy was kind of an asshole but I may be remembering it wrong. He orders either a sandwich or a burger and, because there’s a cockroach infestation, one gets inside his food. He obviously didn’t know that so he takes a bite and then you see half a cockroach still moving in the remaining sandwich/hamburger. He saw he just ate part of a cockroach and then died. I don’t remember much else, there may have been a mice infestation too somewhere later in the movie but maybe I’m confusing it with something else. I’ve been looking for this movie for years, tried googling it but couldn’t find it.

I am starting to think I imaged it. I remember seeing a movie in the 90s. The movie could have been from the 70s, 80s or 90s. It was a horror film I think it was a sequel to another movie. Potential SPOILER ADHEAD....You Been Warned.....Because the scene I remember in the movie was a woman was brought into a kitchen, the camera I think planned from the top so it looked like a movie set or an apartment/house with no roof (could be wrong about the camera panning). In the kitchen, a guy puts his hand in the sink and starts to scream like he lost his hand int he disposal. He pulls out a bloody stump and the girl is scared or screams. The guy starts to laugh and pulls off a glove to show it was a gag/fake. He then resets the glove in the disposal (which is why I think it was a sequel and this was related to something that the woman saw happen in the previous movie where a guy lost his hand in a disposal, not sure if he dies or not). But then as the guy is resetting it, the disposal gag turns for real and he loses his hand. At which point he is escorted away for medical help. Still have not found the movie :(.

The whole movie honestly reminds me of one of those mockumentary movies, or those movies where they know they are being filmed/doing the filming.

They start remodeling the place, but I think strange things start occuring. Eventually they realize the place is inhabited by cannibalistic monster people. I think the movie labeled them as vampires. Not sure though. The scene that I remember the most is when the kid is sleeping in his room, and they have a camera set up in his room. One of the monsters creep in, and reaches ontop of the bed like it was trying to grab him. I think he screams and the thing runs, but I could be wrong. I really hope you guys can help me with this!

At one point he confronts the woman and tells her that he has already bought like (correct?) 10&amp;#37; of the shares. The guy has an Asian assistant with whom he trains judo or karate. During the lesson, he beats up his Asian assistant. at a certian point it becomes clear that the Asian assistant is double crossing him (the assistant acquired behind his back 3&amp;#37; of the shares for himself).

I think the older guy steals the life savings of his wife in order to buy more land -- I think those trees also turn out to be infected or bad in some way. Might have bugs inside them, or something. * There is also *something in the woods*. Some sort of monster or creature that kinda stalks them, and kills the younger dude's dog.

So they used a knife to spread some strawberry jam on the slice of toast, but we end up learning the ""jam"" was actually the blood of the kids parents (I think it was the parents, I know for sure it was blood).

I remember the board being an older fat board (that would fit this timeframe) and I think the camera angle might have been a top down view that I'm not positive though. I don't think skateboarding was a huge part of the plot it just was part of the character (a kid I think) in the beginning of the movie??

This might have been in a movie or a TV show. I watch a lot of anime so it could have been that, and you'd think I could remember but I'm just not sure. It was a somewhat absurd and violent scene that was never fully explained or explained at all. In the scene, some rugged-looking thug gets shot with a weapon and falls to the ground, surrounded by a crowd (I don't remember if he really deserved this fate or not). He begins to lament his impending death, and almost like a ghost or a spirit, a very strange vision of a woman rises from his body. He sees it for a moment before dying and then it either fades away or just disappears into the sky. I really have no idea if this was his soul or something else all together. I've been thinking about this a lot over the last few days and I have no idea what this was from. It had a very dream-like feeling to it but I'm positive that I really watched this and didn't imagine it in my sleep. Any help on this would be really helpful!",0,,,,

The only scenes I remember is that the kids were handcuffed to a bathroom sink, and that someone in the house had ordered pizza and when the pizza delivery boy arrived someone in the house screamed for help and he ran away, the abuductor chasing after him. I also remember them being driven in a car bound and gagged with tape and the father rubbed his face against the wall of the veichle to remove the tape and began to plead with the abductor to let them go.

And I think they ended up on some sort of quest to find these keys! Part way through the movie I think there was a giant creature in the sky which just floated there and did nothing but the main character did something which made the creature fall from the sky! Then I remember at the end they found the last key or something ( i think in a postbox?) And the main character was wearing a decorative mask that covered their eyes Like the ones in Venice! And the main character suddenly seemed to turn evil and betrayed the other person after which they woke up on a balcony to find it was a dream and their mum called them inside and the movie ended!,3,,,,

It starts with some teenage boys in a city and they start harassing a guy and he falls down a subway staircase or some type of stairs and ends up dying. I think a shopping cart may be involved somehow. The kids get away with it. I feel like most of the movie after that was the teens coming together as adults because someone is going to expose them.,2,,,,

Some people left a party through a stairwell and one of them, the red dress girl, tripped and fell. The other partygoers gathered around her. At the age I was around that time, I'm not sure I would've been watching TV when stoner comedies were on and nobody in my family is into anything like that.

It had the vagina too, but it was surrounded by like the actual inner workings of the female reproductive system and I wasn't as interested in that from an aesthetics point of view.

I'm mostly trying to remember her name but I also want to find the movie. The plot mainly was about a guy and a girl who have heard a legend about these reality-type ""gates"" and people whom have taken this journey have only made it through so many gates. They both go into the woods and have some really weird experiences. Eventually the guy wakes up and can't find her. He learns that months have gone by and upon returning home he learns that he is the primary suspect in the girls disappearance. The movie ends with a montage of him trying to cope with his lack of understanding as to what happened and then there is a dedication to the girl who died.

Then he basically chases them the rest of the time. At the end he’s arrested by the cops? Turns out he’s gay at the end.

Genre: Horror, thriller. Country of origin: Most likely the U.S. The protagonist is a woman who's family has been murdered. When it happened, she might have been a litte girl or a young adult. Some time after that, she is employed as a nanny or a housemaid, she has to take care of two siblings (a boy and a girl). Later it seems that the killer is at large again, somebody starts to kill teenagers in town. Close to the house where she works, there is a wooden cottage (?) where a man lives \- a former employee of the family she is working for \- who is suspected to be the killer by some. Two scenes: A young couple is making out on a train, headed for the town, when they are killed. A young guy is killed in some sort of a Jeep or a SUV, parked on a clearing. Near the end of the movie it's revealed that the woman was the killer all along, the trauma of losing her family caused her to become schizophrenic and the new personality was committing the murders. She gets killed eventually by one of the siblings (the girl) she was watching over as a nanny. (The boy didn't make it.) The very end probably shows this surviving girl getting a psychiatric evaluation and she appears to be traumatized in a similar way the protagonist was. The movie might have took place on an island. It's not The Uninvited (2009).",1,,,,

The man is enjoying it, but the woman is clearly not. The man finishes, and is oblivious to any of the woman's emotions. The woman says that's the last time, and I believe walks out on him. The man doesn't understand why the woman is unhappy and tells her to come back/don't go/calm down. It's possible that the woman pretends she's enjoying the sex.

What I remember pretty clearly was a bunch of guys shooting rifles and throwing things into a house, probably revenge for something, and they end up killing a 15 year old mentally disabled kid. At the kid's funeral, a woman stands up to her seemingly aggressive boyfriend and takes off with another man who stood up for her. In the next scene, the older brother of the kid who died gets together with like 8 other guys and they ride off on horseback to find the men responsible. They find them outside of a shop or bar and one man in the group apologizes, saying they went too far or didn't mean to kill a child or something. The older brother says ""My brother was only 15 years old. Now I want you to think about that...*on your way to hell!*"" and then him and his friends starting opening fire, blasting these dudes right through a window. It was so cool.",1,,,,

5190,8r4kpq,tipofmytongue,"[TOMT] [semi-NSFW movie] Comedy, family vacation, wife whores it up, father snaps.",39,8r4kpq,1,2018-06-14 21:22:31,bubonis,"This **is not** any of the *National Lampoon's Vacation* movies, though the era and some elements are similar. I would have seen this movie in the late 1980s or early 1990s. I would have seen it NOT in a theater; it would have been on cable TV or maybe a Blockbuster VHS rental. I don't know if the movie ever was in a theater or if it was a made-for-cable/made-for-TV/straight-to-VHS offering. It was comedy film with adult elements, most likely something made cheaply to capitalize on the popularity of the *National Lampoon's Vacation* movies at the time. The general plot is, the family goes on vacation in France. They somehow get to the Netherlands instead and through whatever comedic manipulations things fall apart and everything lands on the father's lap and he winds up having a mental breakdown. I remember *a lot* about this movie but not enough to identify it with my Google skills. Anyone? Main characters... * Husband/Father (late 30s/early 40s) was almost completely oblivious to how hot his wife is, and there were implications that he's a heavily closeted homosexual and the children aren't his. But he's oblivious to all of this and believes he has a stereotypically perfect American family. * Wife/Mother (similar age as father) is insanely hot but subdued about it; she doesn't walk around flaunting her sexiness, but she uses it for her own advantage when she needs it. Total textbook definition of a MILF. * Oldest child is a 15- or 16-year-old boy who has a serious Oedipus complex but is otherwise a normal-seeming teenager. Mom seems to know about his complex even though it's never directly discussed. He always has a camera or voice recorder with him, I think. * Sister is a few years younger than the boy and thinks that her father is like the best human being on the planet. Throughout the movie she's seen accepting money from mom whenever mom does something ""questionable"". * Third child (maybe a friend, maybe part of the family) is about 9 or 10 years old, is best friends with the ""older sister"", and is just hitting puberty. This was a sort of running joke in the movie; she would often be staring at something that was generally penis-shaped to the point of complete obliviousness to everything around her. Specific scenes... * Early on in the movie, husband and wife are sitting at a table in a bar having drinks and talking about their upcoming vacation. A friend of husband's shows up; wife gets up to refresh her drink and get one for the friend. An extended conversation ensues between the two men. Wife is seen in the background coming out of the men's room with the bartender and returns to the table without any lipstick on and without any drinks. Husband's friend saw where she came from and says nothing; husband is oblivious and just chides her on being so forgetful. * About halfway into the movie the third child-friend wakes up in the middle of the night to go to the bathroom and notices an absurdly large morning wood tent being pitched by the boy-child. She focuses on it, there's some camera play back and forth between her face and the tent, and suddenly it's several hours later and sunlight is coming through the windows. The scene cuts to a restaurant where they're all eating breakfast and she's nodding off, saying she didn't sleep a lot the night before (implying she was staring at his cock all night). * They hit a tourist spot in France and this kind-of-creepy looking guy shows up and almost immediately starts flirting like mad with the sister-child, who generally accepts it ""because he's French"". He speaks French to her and the captions show that he's saying things like ""I want to swirl my tongue around your budding nipples"" but since nobody in the movie speaks French he's never called out on it. Eventually the boy-child gets a French-English dictionary, figures it out, and tells dad who chases the Frenchman away. But at every subsequent tourist spot they go to, the Frenchman is there like a stalker and whenever the dad sees he chases him away again. The sister-child is seen reading the dictionary and figuring out what the man was saying to her, and whenever she saw him stalking her she waves and flirts. * The family had been driving for hours and hours and finally found a hotel they could afford. Everyone eats dinner and goes to sleep almost immediately, but the wife decides to go for a walk. She returns in the wee-early hours of the morning badly disheveled (hair messed up, missing her stockings, make up gone, etc -- clearly had a night of partying) and manages to get into the shower just before the husband wakes up. Husband looks outside and realizes they're in a seedier part of Amsterdam. There's a group of men outside who smile and wave and laugh at him; he goes back inside and remarks how friendly the locals were. Wife comes out of the shower and says something like ""you have no idea"" and remarks that they should stay for a few more nights. * Boy-child is increasingly frustrated by not having any privacy to masturbate. The family stops at a motel for the night and he sees a nearby laundromat. There's a brief fantasy sequence of him grinding up against a washing machine, then he comes out of it and offers to do the family's laundry. He gives a clumsy reminder to his mother that he will be careful when washing her underwear, which gets a disgusted look from his sister and a predatory smile from mom. * In the grand finale, the husband basically snaps. Unfortunately I don't remember exactly what happened to make him snap (hence the reason why I'm looking for this movie) but the movie closes with him flying back to the United States in first class, the three children in the back (business class?), and then the camera pans down to a wooden crate in the cargo hold (implying that's where his wife is).",3,,,,

5243,8r4rxh,tipofmytongue,[TOMT][VIDEO] Short sketch about a guy who doesn't watch the end of movies and because he misunderstand where the end is,2,8r4rxh,1,2018-06-14 21:47:19,Schizofish,"I've been looking for this for a few years, which probably means that it's a video from around 2008\-2012... maybe. I remember most of the sketch and I can see it in my head, but I just can't find it. The premise of the video is a couple of guys at a workplace, I think, who are discussing Sister's Act 2. One of the guy says that he cut off before the end, because he didn't find it worth watching since they didn't get to perform at the competition (as their song had already been sung by the other group). The guy he's talking to then says that they did in fact perform, even though they had the same song. So the first guy goes home and re\-watches the movie, but when the judge says ""First runner up..."" and names the other team he shuts the movie off, because he thinks first runner up is the winner and he doesn't want to continue watching when they've already lost.

It wasn’t until grade 11 in my law class that I learned what snuff films were so I’m hoping that what movie scenes I saw were actually some fictional murder movie. I was partially asleep when I woke up to this movie but my affinity for scary movies kept me watching - basically, I may be fuzzy on some details. It was shown through what seemed like camera’s littered through hallways and bedrooms of what seemed to be a dorm house where multiple people lived. Either the woman lived there and the cameras were for security or the men lived there and the cameras were there to film their murderous adventures. So, depending on who actually lived in the house either the men brought the women back or the women brought the men back. Either or, the men would enjoy their night with the female before each began a chase of their respective woman through the house. I remember one man chasing the woman with a big chefs knife. I remember one incident one man was dragging one woman down the hallway. Another scene near the end was of one of the woman sitting in front of the camera having been stabbed (I think) to death. Edit: To include a little more information. I was around six years old so the movie had to be 2000 or older. It looked exactly like what it would look like if you were watching something through a security camera. There weren’t any scenes of filming like a traditional film and if there was it would be as if someone was holding a camcorder.",3,,,,

The train crashes/derails and the impact hits them, killing the girl in the window seat and leaving her in a paraplegic. * The mom doesn't want to tell her the other girl died (i think the mom was in the train too, just wasn't injured badly because she moved to the back), but she finds out anyway.

She heads to the airport, meets a guy, and they screw in the airplane bathroom (she drags him off, really) **year of movie:** definitely not after 2005. **2:** I only remember the end of this one. I believe the main character was trying to get his ex wife and daughter back. It was an action movie. In the end, he throws someone under a nodding donkey to kill them. He keeps his daughters pink teddy bear throughout the movie so he can return it. He does in the end, tries to wipe off some oil on it to hand it to her and she just looks at him. The main character had long, blonde hair. **year of movie:** pre-2007 **3:** I remember just one scene from this one, I couldve sworn Tom cruise is in it. Him and a lady in the movie kiss, and the camera does a 360 view of them kissing while they grow old, have their skeletal/musketal system appear in the position, and then back to present time **year of movie:** ~2007 **4:** movie about a teen boy that stresses his mom out being reckless, he gets in a car accident and his soul goes to heaven(??) and the angel who kept him from dying goes into disguise and develops a crush on his mom, meanwhile the boys soul is trying to make things right and make things right so he can awake from his coma. There's a plot twist at the end; the coworker his mom was into tries to kill her, but fails. **year of movie:** definitely 80s or 90s... Good luck buckaroos",1,,,,

The episode had a slightly different than normal animation style which peaked my interest, sparking a short debate/guessing at what year it was from. I only saw probably the middle third to half so no end or starting cards with the year. The different animation style lead me to believe it was an early episode. It also had more dialog and music than I think was standard for the later shorts. (I could be mis-remembering the amounts of these in them though and it has a standard amount). The plot that I saw was, a mouse I presume to be Jerry is in a store, there is another mouse in a diaper, like nibbles, but this mouse is only a slightly different shade to the other mouse not grey like nibbles is. A store owner who calls for Tom (Perhaps a different name, hearing the name in the background was what originally made the cartoon catch my interest but didn't quite catch it. I know Tom was originally called jasper, and it sounded similar to that but I could be imagining the similarity) to come catc h the mice in the store. The store owner promises ""All the fish you can eat for a year"" if he can catch the mice. From then it proceeded like a normal Tom and Jerry, but with possibly more than normal music. Several times Tom gets the diaper wearing mouse into a bird cage and Jerry outsmarts Tom and gets the other mouse back out. I've spent about 30 minutes googling and reading the plot summaries on the [Tom and Jerry filmography](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tom_and_Jerry_filmography) wiki page but none of them seem to match. Perhaps I'm just missing something or am bad at searching but its driving me crazy. Hope someone here knows or can find this episode.",1,,,,

I saw this movie no later than 2006. I know it’s not silent hill, the American werewolf in London, fright night, or the howling. The movie was in color and in English.

It was a post-apocalyptic movie about a bunch of kids who, I think, a parental-guardian figure dies and leaves them with clues to find Eden. Their current residence was like a massive warehouse or some kind of heavily policed Cube Building full of tight knit rows of junkers which was, of course, perfect for an on-foot chase scene. I feel like there were subtle religious implications and very likely were considering this was around the time my grandparents sent me to Church camp (partially irrelevant but hey). The kids go through this maze of obstacles while being chased by The Big Bads including an underground maze (???). Eventually, they find Eden which is basically an island paradise all beaches and palm trees and then it just ends there.",2,,,,

I'm pretty sure it's from the 90s, but possibly the mid-late 80s. The setting is somewhere in England or Ireland, probably late 1800s or early 1900s. A young doctor at a hospital decides to operate on a homeless man who seems to be dying of appendicitis. No one in the hospital wants to help, but he does it in front of a class. The homeless man ultimately dies, but he notices that his skull has cracked with a blunt object and that he shouldn't have been alive. He find out he was treated by another doctor for the head wound and is fascinated by it. He tracks down where the man is from and decides to go there in hopes of finding the doctor. It's near a small villiage and he stays at an inn there. The bar maid flirts with him and everyone tells him the doctor is on an island, but no one wants to go there and no one will tell him why. The young doctor finally convinces someone to take him on a boat and they go over. There are a number of people on the island and all seem a bit off. He mentions he's looking for the doctor and the people there try to turn him away. He goes on past them and finds the older doctor's mansion in the middle of the island. He sees the older doctor's daughter injecting someone who's unresponsive with a potion and that brings them back to life. It turns out the cure isn't permanent and the doctor has to keep making it for them. He's actually more of a prisoner and they people on the island have cut his legs off to prevent him from escaping. The older doctor has decided he doesn't want the potion to leave the island and he's been giving the people there a fake potion so they will eventually die when the effects of the real potion wear off. When the people on the island realize what's happening they attack the mansion and the young doctor escapes with the older doctor's daughter. They fight to the docks but the young doctor is knocked out before they escape. The young doctor wakes up on the mainland with the older doctor's daughter. She's dying because she had previously died and been reanimated by the potion, but also wanted it destroyed because of the damage it could do. At the end he out with the bar maid reflecting on the events and it's hinted they will be together.",2,,,,

The kid says that he never made coco before so how can he know. He replies with I have made coco 867 times before (or sth like that). The mother (his brothers wive) gets frustrated at him when she comes back from sth and sees that the kids missed the school bus. The main charter tells he that he saw some issue with the engines of the school bus and thought it was unsafe for them to get on it. Later she drives them to school and on the way saw that the school bus had broke down half way. The protagonist starts studying the sky with his equipment while everyone is gone and started doing calculations on his notebook. Meanwhile at NASA they detect a meteor coming at earth and they try to come up with a plan. Fast forward some discussions. In the end the governments of the world had 2 plans in mind. China's one to use nuclear bomb to bomb up the earth and shift the plates or sth I cant really rember how they explained it. Or the USA one to have two missile collide at each other at the exact spot and time to do sth that I forgot as well. Everyone ends up with agreeing with China but USA was determined to do it their way. However there is a problem, the two experts tells them that they dont have enough time to do the calculations and I think the quote was ""That will require alot of calculations. I mean we can do it but I dont think you have enough paper for us to write on"" (Can I add that I think the two experts are married to each other and they are really weird geniuses as well). Back to the protagonist, while this is happening he manages to convince his brother that the contents in his computer will save the planet (apparently he has done the calculations weeks beforehand) and they spend a major part of the movie trying to get him to NASA and the journey is very difficult coz people are going crazy. In the end he reaches NASA and the two expert are surprised and thinks the maths is correct and they managed to execute the plan in the nick of time. In the end they created a wormhole instead than the screen goes black. We jump back to the beginning of the movie where the nephew complains about the coco.

In one scene she tries to seduce her (ex?) boyfriend and when he won't give in she is really nasty. I think she calls him a faggot, et cetera. 4. In another scene, and I think this is when I quit watching, she tells her father she has a lump in her breast and nags him into doing a breast exam.

Been trying to identify it ever since (rather, identify an actor in it, but for that I need to know the film). Salient details I can remember are: 1) Single mother? Either way, I only remember the mother of the kids being involved. She's the protagonist I think. 2) Viewpoint from her kids as well. It switches to the victims's viewpoint also. It shows how they cope and how her daughter (adolescent/young teenager) tries to escape. 3) The perpetrators. Husband/wife team. As title says, I think the wife was more the driving force, and the husband was playing along/was being controlled by her. Both were causasian (as are mum and kids). 4) Location. The husband/wife are revealed to be serial killers/child abusers. They have a room set up that looks like a kids play room, the the cushioned floor is covered in easy wipe-down plastic, for the blood (presumably). The son (I think) discovers name tags hidden in the room, which are hinted at to be trophies they took of their previous victims. 5) Other key points.

Music, lighting, everything, makes it pretty tense. She's basically telling the old joke about Gandhi being on a hunger strike, and being very serious about it (again, the lighting, music, etc. add to this). The joke goes something like this ... Gandhi is on a hunger strike and someone is interviewing him, etc. etc. etc. ... and he says to the interviewer ""come closer"" a few times, and once he gets right next to him, Gandhi says ""bring me a f**king sandwich"". The woman laughs, and that's the end of the scene. They key thing is that it seems like it's a tense scene. I don't know if the movie is a comedy, drama, horror, etc.; I just remember this scene.

I know for sure I saw this clip as part of some in-flight entertainment, however it was on another passenger's screen and not my own. This definitely was within the last two years. I think the flight in question occurred during summer 2017. There is some possibility that this was on an international flight either to or from France. Not sure about that but it may help. I don't really remember many specific details. A man and a woman are in the woods together, both appeared on the younger/middle-aged side. The man kills the woman by striking her in the head with a large rock. I think he held the rock with both hands (maybe not). The color palette was dark, maybe it was winter or late in the day. I don't think the scene took place at night. The woman may have been wearing something red, don't know for sure. I also don't think she realized she was in danger right away, I don't recall a struggle or a chase but I could very well be wrong about that. The image has stuck with me more than if I had just watched the movie, I love psychological thrillers/horror films, because I enjoy them and it's easy for me to process them, then dump the emotional overload and move on. Without the context of the story this ""memory"" is sticking to me almost as if I'd seen an actual murder - so I'd love to just watch the film and be done with it. Thanks in advance!",1,thanks?,,,

It definitely looked more modern, but I'm not really sure when it would have been made. Also, I'm leaning more towards it being a movie and not a show. I think this scene was towards the end of the movie. I think it was the main character driving, a sort of tough guy, and someone, what I think might have been a kid, was in the backseat. Not sure if it was actually his own kid. He kept repeating things like, ""Stay with me. Don't go to sleep."" I think one time he may have even reached back to shake them awake, and swerving the car in the process. It was a big ""will they make it"" moment. They finally arrive at the hospital, and it cuts to a scene of the man standing outside of his car, I think he may have been smoking. I remember the driving scene being kind of dark, and I think it looked really purple and blue.

5734,8rdjg9,tipofmytongue,[TOMT] [MOVIE] Movie loosely based on 1966 University of Texas tower shooting,7,8rdjg9,1,2018-06-15 21:11:44,The_Conkerer,"It was a live action movie I saw the movie on IFC (Independent Film Channel) back in probably 2008-2009, the latest it could be from is 2010. The beginning of the movie follows a kind of dorky looking college kid during his day walking around campus while he talks about very mundane stuff like his life, like classes, his roommate, etc. He seems like he might be learning disabled or just very oblivious. As he's walking through the courtyard of the school someone starts shooting at people from a clock tower or some other tall building in the middle of the campus. The main character and other students scatter and run into nearby buildings, he ends up in the tower the shooter is in and eventually reaches the top to find out it's his roommate who is the shooter. The roommate explains that he is doing this because his girlfriend back home has mysteriously vanished, he tried calling her and her phone is disconnected, he tried talking to her parents and they say they have never had a daughter. He is worried that he is going to disappear as well and wants to cause enough of a tragedy that can't happen. I think he's eventually stopped and the movie ends with the main character walking around campus discussing how it seems weird that no one seems to remember or talk about what happened with his roommate, it's like he's the only one who remembers, seeming like the shooter wasn't crazy and that something supernatural is happening. The roommate looked very similar Charles Whitman (blond buzz cut) but it was very specific that he had been in the boy scouts and that was where he learn most of everything he knew. I'm not sure if it was actually set in 1966 or not but I want to say the movie itself was more recent. The movies that come up when searching ""Texas University tower shooting movie"" are Deadly Tower (1975) and Targets (1968) I don't think either of these are it, they seem to be more about the cops involved or the shooter, the movie I'm thinking of entirely follows the perspective of the roommate and his inner thoughts.",2,,,,

I also remember them being driven in a car bound and gagged with tape and the father rubbed his face against the wall of the veichle to remove the tape and began to plead with the abductor to let them go.

Probably around 10 or 15 years ago I watched a murder mystery on television. I think this movie was made in the 2000s and took place somewhere in the UK, but I could be wrong. It wasn't a scary movie, but more of a drama with some mild thriller elements. It starred a female lead (the protagonist) who became obsessed with a case where a teenage girl was apparently murdered but they never found a body. I think the protagonist was a journalist. The movie opens with the protagonist watching an eerie video of the murdered girl, who has heavy eyes and long black hair, walking and looking over her shoulder back at the camera every now and then like she's not comfortable with being filmed. There were other unnerving elements as well like a child's drawing of a stick figure with a camera for a head standing in the top window of a home. The woman begins investigating this odd case herself to find the town is weirdly against talking about the case. The great plot twist was the whole town actually banded together years ago to fake the death of this girl to frame a man who had been terrorizing the whole town with sexual assault. ""He got everyone"" I think I remember one woman saying. He would victims them up into an attick and take naked pictures of them (hence the man with the camera head). The town was determined enough to fake the murder they actually cut and bled the girl for a few days so they could have enough blood to throw on the ground as evidence of her death (the girl seemed willing to do this). They hid the girl ever since. By faking the girl's death and framing the man the town was able to execute him and bring justice and peace. I remember they hung him to death in a prison and the movie showed this. In the end the protagonist actually meets the ""murdered"" girl, who is alive and still in hiding. I remember her coming down the stairs dramatically looking to be at least 30 years old. I've tried every google search possible. This was the first murder mystery I ever watched and I would love to know what it was called. Thank you!",1,thanks?,,,

It's a pretty big warehouse with pallets laden with the product stacked on top of each other. I think they might get into a fight with the antagonists within the warehouse, but there is definitely a fight later on. The fight continues outside, into the warehouse yard (it's night). Outside, there is a large industrial vehicle, like a JCB/Backhoe (or something similar) which I'm fairly certain plays a part in the fight. I think that a female character takes control of the Backhoe and is overrun by zombies (mightn't be zombies at all). Male or female character maybe rushes in to help her. That's about all I can recall. The movie is recent-ish, probably within the last 10 years, and I don't think it would be older than 2000. I could possibly be mixing up two different movies between inside and outside the warehouse, but it's the outside part with the Backhoe that I'm interested in.

Just that it’s a film about a guy at university who has this particular class/paper (possibly a writing/english class) where they have write about a topic of their choosing. He, I think, initially pitches the idea to his professor (white old guy- typical university lecturer I guess)  who doesn’t really approve of it (doesn’t think he can know much about it or something). The rest of the film is him investigating/going undercover/deep web/hacking or something-ing this event/group/phenomenon/topic and then finally at the end I do believe he ends up finishing/writing his paper and handing it into his professor who I think is pleased with it. The main character is not the nerd type, he's more of the talented/got potential/genius shoelaces-undone cool but actually smart guy. The lead, I think, was a reasonably attractive young guy (in his 20s? the character that is) with dark hair (not blond or ginger) with a fairly slim/lean build. The film was in English and I think was probably American. I don’t think this was a recent film. My guess would be somewhere from 1998-2010. It’s possible that what he investigates is something gay-related (I’m just taking a stab in the dark here- I’m gay, I tend to be interested in movies with gay themes), though I do think the lead character is straight.

I think I saw this in school when I was about seven or eight, so around '86-'87, although it might have been from the early '80s or possibly '70s. The only scene I remember (that I'm certain is in this film) is an overhead view of a recliner or upholstered chair (I keep seeing it as orange or red) with a lit cigarette that had fallen on it, and a (kid's?) voice in the background saying something like ""What's wrong?"" and a woman, who is trying to keep the cigarette moving but oddly not picking it up for some reason (I remember this bugged me), says ""Oh, it's one of your father's cigarettes."" I can't remember if the recliner/chair actually caught on fire. There was another scene that I remember but I'm not certain it was from the same video (we had a lot of fire safety videos in school). This one had a person (I think a woman but I'm not sure) in what I'm pretty sure was a group setting who asked a fire safety expert why you should not put metal in a microwave. The FSE took a (coffee?) cup with a metal spoon inside and put it in a microwave so the group could see it sparking inside.",1,,,,

Its playing on a spaceship, sometimes you see the cyborg's point of view, its kinda seeing like the Terminator, crosshair, noise level meter on the side, some sort of other meter on the other side. Mechanical sounds play every time the robot takes a step. The cyborg is attracted to noise, and movement, and this is the scene I remember the most. Near the end of the movie the characters figure out, if they dont move, dont breath, the cyborg wont notice them. Like four of them stand still, the cyborg comes up, it even looks close at the main characters, they barely manage to stay motionless, and are sweating heavily. Cyborg looks like Frank Zagarino.

I think his mother was an infomercial narrator? It had a dramatic tone to it, and everyone spoke in a dialect ""standard"" to their line of work.

I think she made her stand in a room full of flies or something. The movie was shot in black and white, so to my kid mind it was pretty disturbing. I am not sure, but I think the movie itself is about a couple of days from their life and how the mean girl affects the shy one.

(It was not that newly released) As far as I remember the scientists found a crystal with genetic code in it. It helped them unlock the mysteries of creating new life forms by an ease. Some scientist group created a creature which had all the genes of living animals on earth combined into one to make it the fearsome beast (and then as we uncovered it was meant to used as a weapon by a government *wah wah*) Something goes wrong and government sends secret armed agents to see what's going on. The cientist's lab was located in remote area surrounded by unclimbable cliffs and mountains so the spec team had to be transported by a helicopter. The movie had very Alien-y feel to its action, from the creature striking from vents to the lighting and atmosphere in sum. The spec team dies out pretty soon but one of them - asian looking woman survives and finds one of the scientist who had also survived and then tons of things happen. Anyways at the end they manage to blow up the lab with nuke or something and they escape with helicopter. I am still fascinated by the film, maybe because I am into sci-fi horror monster movies and maybe because I watched it in my teen years and I got really excited. If you know the name of the movie I would be more than happy to finally find it and watch it again. Thank you in advance! P.S I looked it up everywhere and got nothing",3,thanks?,,,

I can recall some more things: The spec-ops team had briefing before being sent to the lab and as far as I remember they did not know what they would be facing in the lab. The lab was located in snowy remote mountainous range (it was in the middle of nowhere. the place was surrounded by mountains that created a circle, some kind of pit) The creature was said to be able to withstand extreme heat and cold, its skin was bulletproof (due to its thickness)... it walked on four legs, the movie was mostly shot in dark, (because electricity was cut off in lab) not revealing the monster for a long time and it built up the suspense pretty well. I remember one scene at the climax of the movie where the female spec-ops agent and the young (probably redhead or brown haired) scientist are trying to escape and find the exit, they open a room which is filled with tiny creatures (children of the monster) trying to breakthrough the bulletproof glass (some of then escapes and chases them down). P.S I don't remember if they somehow managed to defeat the creature and after that those younglings begun to sprout out of its body or they found out that it reproduces.",1,,,,

It's a shot of two men walking on railroad tracks. They are being filmed from behind and the camera is keeping up with them, but far enough away that their whole bodies are in the shot. They are walking toward a tunnel bored into a hill or mountain or something. They both are kind if looking around as they approach, and the second they enter the tunnel, they disappear completely into the shadows. It's kind of striking how completely they go from visable in daylight to vanishing into the darkness totally. They men might be carrying guns. I feel like there walking into the tunnel because it's the only way to get somewhere and time is an issue. The guys are definitely weary of their surroundings. There may be a post-apocolyptic vibe happening. The men do not share a word. There's also kind of a""No Country for Old Men"" vibe I think. The move (or show, I suppose) is relatively recent.

It was easily watchable in one day. I have posted about this series before, and the details are hazy, but I had a dream about this show/movie last night, so this is a long shot and I could be completely wrong. I remember the show revolved around a woman, and the main character fell in love with her through the couse of the show, but they had to tranport her to a destination, but she was captured, there was an outbreak or virus or something that put humanity at risk, and she was they key to solving the problem, after her capture she was kept in a facility ran by the ""bad guys"" and it was up to the team transporting her to get her back, and save the world, or typical anime bs. I dont specifically remember mechs in this show, and neither does my friend who watched it with me, I remember the show was more story focused, but had really good fight scenes. I wanna say towards the beggining of the show it was more desert landscape, but as the show progressed so did buildings and machinery.

I might get this mixed up but I think the little girl was the patient in the film, and the man was looking after her, or treating her. They could have had british accents. The room the girl was in was very dark and dark green, actually the whole movie had a very dark vibe with not much bright colours, with bars on the windows and the girl might have been in a cage. I think the little girl had some strange condition as if something was haunting her. I remember one scene where there were lots of strobe lights going on and off and it was pissing her off. She did seem rather calm with this man though. It was not a gory film at all. Might be a long shot, but I was watching this movie with a girl and we never finished it.

I don’t recall any humans in the movie, although they might have appeared in minor roles with no dialog as with Lobo. It was in color and had a 1960s feel, but it could possibly be from the 50s through the early 70s.

One night we all decided to watch a movie so we rented a movie in Japanese and put on English subtitles to make it easier for our guest. I've got very vague memories of this movie and was wondering if anyone would be familiar with it. There was this girl (really she probably would have been in her twenties) and she was looking at a stream. I think the main conflict in the movie was a war of some kind and this girl was on one side and the boy she loved was on the other. I think most of the main characters had a super power of some form. One girl had a butterfly power thing where she could conjure butterflies that could slice and attack people. The main girl (from the stream) didn't know what her power was but then as she was fleeing some people on horse back she made eye contact with one of her pursuers and it somehow caused him to die (I think it either caused his heart to stop or explode). I remember the penultimate scene was when the two lovers had to attack each other and as they ran towards each other the girl stabbed the boy with a sword. The girl is then the last of the superhero people (I think) and stabs out her own eyes with her fingers because she doesn't want her power (or thinks it's too powerful?). The movie ends back at the stream it started at, with the girl now blind listening to the water. Now that I think about it, the war might have been a battle to the death, pitting all the superhero people against one another. I know this is kind of all over the place and I don't know how accurate my descriptions are as I was about 8 or 9 when I saw it.",1,,,,

It was one of those movies like Love Actually/Happy New Year/Valentines Day, where there are a bunch of love stories that are kind of connected. The movie was centred around this guy who was a Psychologist or Psychiatrist, and kept talking to his 3 daughters about their love lives, and interfering sometimes. Thanks everyone! Some things I remember (massive spoilers): * One daughter was gay and proposed to her girlfriend who then broke up with her, so she decided to be straight to solve her problems, and asked the dad to help her out. She sneezes whenever she's attracted to a girl, and in the movie she sneezed once with a guy too (he was really hot), at a bar or something. But then he left her to date/marry his female cousin, which was funny/sad because she was attracted to the cousin too, and was struggling to resist her and be faithful * The youngest daughter was in high school and she was dating a guy her dad's age, who was also married (and having an affair) and worked in a place like IKEA (where they spent all their time pretending it was their house or something), and the dad spends most of the movie sabotaging that relationship by giving the older guy counselling so he will want to be with his wife again, but he's telling him the counselling is to get over his wife * BUT the dad also has a crush on this lady he sees on the street all the time, who ends up being the wife of the older guy dating his daughter, so then his motivations becoming confusing, and the drama of the movie, I guess, is when the wife finds out about the affair and the daughter finds out about the secret counselling * The other daughter owns a bookshop and falls in love with a guy who keeps stealing books from her shop, and he is deaf and their relationship is frustrating because she doesn't know how to treat him. At one point, dad is helping by standing behind the guy and telling her what to say (he can't hear the dad), but it turns out he was seeing the dad in a mirror the whole time and found it endearing",1,thanks?,,,

He brought her to the garbage shoot of the ship and showed her if you 'flushed' it, it would disassemble all the garbage into its base components to recycle.

A husband and wife are sleeping in a bed. The husband wakes up and sees a man with a gun leaning against the wall. But when the husband rubs his eyes, he sees that the gunman is gone. Turns out it's just a hallucination. The second scene takes place in the kitchen. Another man, possibly a bodyguard, suspects that someone is hiding in the kitchen. He looks inside and sees what looks like a woman with her back turned. The bodyguard is relieved and sits down at the table. But the woman turns around, and it is revealed that it's actually a man wearing a wig and a dress. He creeps out behind the bodyguard and uses piano wire to suffocate him. The wire cuts right through the bodyguard's throat, causing blood to spill right out. The bodyguard shoots his gun at the ceiling, prompting the other people in the house to realize that a killer is on the loose. These are the only two scenes that I remember. I saw it way back in the mid 1990's when I was a kid. Somebody was watching it on VHS when I was in the room, and my parents immediately switched it off as soon as the second scene ended.

I’m pretty sure it was made no earlier than the 2000s. It’s a European film (maybe German or Russian?) set in winter where a soldier finds a seemingly abandoned building. However, there’s some children in the building and I remember one of them wore a creepy mask. Anyway I think other soldiers attacked the building and the children and the other soldier starting firing at them (I’m pretty sure the building went on fire too). Sorry I can’t remember much else but the movie itself was actually really good. If anyone knows what it’s called I’d really appreciate it!",1,,,,

They're a little thicker than the picture. They float in space and crash into each other, I think. That's all i remember. The **second** movie is animated \(not anime\). There's a world, with a ton of buildings on it, and the buildings all get fucked up and destroyed, and they end up floating in the atmosphere of the planet like [this, but higher up in the sky](http://i.kinja-img.com/gawker-media/image/upload/t_original/yhrs5vnlrdlllqdwzcwj.jpg). They are huge, tall buildings. The main character is floating through the destroyed buildings on a small platform made of stone \(that was part of a building originally\).

I'm looking for a pretty old movie, like in the year of 70 or 80. I remember a castle's owner invites several people to his castle to find easter eggs (probably very luxury and expensive eggs), and people are dressed as some characters since it's a masquerade ball. The heroine, a reporter, is one of the guests and she dressed as a warrior with a bow where she hides her camera. Then guests are killed one by one during the egg hunting. One of the ladies is sewed into a weaving machine by threads through her skin. Another man was chopped by being tied under a big clock whose pendulum is an ax. I know the plot is pretty brutal, but the movie should be a mystery film rather than a thrilling movie. Another lady, in the end, turns out to be the serial killer and she has a fight with the heroine. And the killer is killed by being stabbed by the arrows on the top of the grate's fence. Thank you XD",1,thanks?,,,

All I can remember is a sketchy-looking man (i think he was wearing a trench coat and hat??) pulling a frightened woman aside into either an alleyway opening or a hallway, grabbing her by the shoulders, and hurriedly whispering something in her ear. I get the vibe that they're working together somehow, like in a way where he's the puppetmaster of the schene and she's a puppet that he secretly orders around, or orders her to keep her mouth shut about things. Idk, that could be wrong, but that's the vibe I get. You don't hear at all what the man says, i believe the only sound in the scene is low suspenseful/dramatic background music.

They're maybe the protagonists, or at least they're the most major characters in the scene. One of the gunmen goes up to the driver's window of a white panel van (Ford Econoline or similar) parked in a parking garage. There's a guy sitting in the driver's seat. The gunman demands that he hand over something on the passenger seat, probably a small black and silver case. The driver refuses, but the gunman is really timid and doesn't shoot him. The gunman's partner shows up and shoots the driver. (I think the timid gunman was in his twenties and had blond hair that was long enough to reach the bottom of his ears or so, and he'd taken off his mask (if he'd been wearing one) when he started demanding the case.) Then two other guys, one of whom looks like Donald Trump, walk by. The gunmen put them up against the side of the van and shoot them. They slide down, leaving smears of blood on the van. The gunmen get in the van and speed away. *** I'm pretty sure I remember looking at the release date of the movie and seeing a year in the early 1990s, and the Trump lookalike looks a lot like Trump did then, so much so that I seriously wondered if that was really him. But I checked his filmography and didn't see any titles I recognized except for *Home Alone 2*. The guy who looked like Trump was not seen in any other scene in the movie, nor was Donald Trump's name ever said. I had a vague thought that this was from *Catch Me If You Can*, but I can't think where the scene would fit in the movie and Wikipedia didn't mention such a scene.

I watched this on IFC probably in the mid-to-late 90s. There was a conference room full of men, but they had very exaggerated faces. It's possible they were blockheads, or that the faces were animation/CGI, but it was definitely live action otherwise if not entirely. Instead of speaking they all had tape recorders around their necks. The boss tells a joke and they all play their tapes to laugh, but the main guy can't turn his recorder off and it just keeps playing the laugh. He looks horrified, with this big open mouth. The boss summons him to the front of the room and gives him a different tape, and he knows what it is, but he has no choice. He puts it into his recorder and it plays a scream as he jumps out the window. You'd think with all these details, it'd be easy to find, but I haven't had any luck. TIA!",2,,,,

They get back late with everyone looking for them and the reunion is a mix of anger, and relief on the part of the parents. Towards the end of the movie the barlady/love interest has to leave town, and the author end p proposong to her with an empty ring box and an imaginary ring. The father (who is a rich motor company owner) of the kid ends up finding his child, and taking him away from the author leaving him alone once again. The fact the father was coming to take his son comes from a letter, and the time after the author recieves the letter, he tries pushing away the kid, despite their now strong bond with esch other.

I have a memory of a seeing a quite disturbing episode or tv movie when I was little, I think I was about 10 years old. I think it was supposed to be for kids, or being broadcast on a kids channel, but containing some disturbing stuff. My mom turned the TV off when she noticed. I have had this memory triggered periodically, but now I finally know of this sub so here it goes. Unfortunately I'm very low on details but this is what I remember. It was drawn, like a cartoon, it was quite neatly done as well. It took place somewhere in Africa, not modern day, think of tribal conditions, simple huts and stuff like that. I'm almost certain there was (evil) magic involved as well. I also remember a pregnant woman and someone (I don't know if it was the woman herself or not) having to crawl through a tunnel to do something - save them? protect them? something important and dangerous anyway. I wish I could remember more, this is all I have for now. It is not a fun memory, and back then I even think I had some bad nights because of it, but I'm quite curious to know what ever this was.",3,,,,

There they battle with Pokémon type monsters, but they were geared towards boy gross out type of humor, I think one of the monsters was an actual toilet, or at least was similar to one.

I saw a short clip (presumably the beginning) of the movie when I was little and I came into the living room while my mom was watching TV in the middle of the night. Something about the movie just screams ''Sci Fi Original Movie'' (cheesy) to me but I haven't been able to find it online, so maybe it was one of those cheap flicks on some random horror channel. What I remember, vaguely, is this guy in an old building (seemed kind of like an art studio or somewhere to store ancient relics and shit) and it looked like maybe it was set in Italy or Spain, set in an old time. Anyway the guy is in the room, and he finds this old rickety box and pulls out some kind of artifact- a big white sphere (though it could have been more like an eggshell color, or marbled). I don't remember the dialogue in the movie but it seemed like it was a very bad artifact that you shouldn't fuck with. I don't remember if it was him or a friend of his, but one of them touched it and it kind of swallowed (more like absorbed) his arm and he couldn't get it off. I don't remember if it completely swallowed him or if he died. I don't remember anything immediately after that, but I do remember these two girls that had SOMETHING to do with this sphere, either appearing out of nowhere or coming out of the sphere, killing one (or both) of the dudes and leaving- the last scene I remember is the two chicks walking down the street in a kind of regal fashion, basically naked but covered in these robe things (more like a poncho maybe??) that were worn and really thin, like they were made of cobwebs or something. I feel like I might have found the movie ages ago but I don't remember it, and it's one of those things that I sit awake at night thinking about or spending hours trying to find it on Google.",3,,,,

I don't have really any memory of the plot other than it was a live action movie where the main character was a real cat, voiced by a guy. The cat i think was black with some white on it. The cat, being he, got lost from home, and wanted to get back to his owner who I think was a girl. The big scene that I remember is that the cat is in a construction site, and comments on a Caterpillar Tractor being called CAT, and wanted to use the tractor as shelter. Not 100&amp;#37; sure or not, but pretty sure at some point he meets a female cat thats voiced by a girl. I remember the quality being somewhat bad, so I'm assuming it was a movie made sometime between 1985-2005 and it was a straight to dvd release picked up at a blockbuster.

Young woman in new apartment dealing with controlling neighbor,4,8s6k4n,1,2018-06-19 08:06:09,BullyFU,"I don't remember a lot of this movie, I want to say I saw it on IFC back in the day before they started airing commercials and played movies without breaks and uncensored. The main character was a young women in her 20's who had just moved into an apartment building that was very nice, upscale. She had an upstairs neighbor she made friends with who was maybe 20 years older than her, in her 40's. They were friends at first but then as the young girl tried to live her life the upstairs neighbor lady got very controlling and jealous. If the young girl had friends over she'd make a bunch of noise so it was virtually impossible for the young women to entertain guests. The older woman didn't like ""sharing"" her new friend. She tormented her, I want to say she got her fired from her job and also caused her boyfriend to break up with her. The young lady tried confronting her to no avail, the older neighbor tried acting like it was all the young girls head and none of that was happening. The young girl couldn't sleep, have a social life, or a professional life. Finally she submitted to the women upstairs and I want to say the woman upstairs tried taking advantage of her sexually when she submitted to her. I can't remember much else. I believe the lead was a brunette? Like I said I think it was a film showed on IFC in the late 90's or early 2000's and probably made around that time. It was sort of like a Single White Female type of thriller but it was an odd indy film. I do know it was an apartment building, because there was an elevator to go from one floor to the next. Possibly set in New York? The neighbor may be a little older, in her 50's? Maybe.",1,,,,

The Young Man meets an Older Charming Man, leaves his GF and enters into a relationship with him. Eventually he begins to realise how manipulative the Older Charming Man is. He meets an Ex of the Older Charming Man, a Trans Woman who was once a man who was made to transition to keep the Older Charming Man happy. (He then dumped her.) The Young Man bumps into his ex-GF, who wants him to come back to her. The Young Man wants to go but then the Older Charming Man comes home early and within minutes he has sweet talked the GF into bed, much to the Young Man's despair. The Older Charming Man has a threesome with the GF and his Trans Ex (who is there for some reason). Realising he'll never be able to escape this Older Charming Man, the Young Man kills himself (I think by drinking bleach?) literally while the others are still in the bedroom. It ends with the Trans Ex finding him and looking out of the window (possibly touching it, like she'll never escape this OLDER CHARMING MAN). Something like that.",1,,,,

They are ambushed along the way and are forced to make a last stand at an abandoned farmhouse. The over-the-top bad guy sends waves and waves of people to fight them. But through their cleverness and badassness they hold them off. Had a real 3 musketeers vibe to it.

I think the plot was this guy's sister dated a guy who started filming them having sex and was abusing and raping her. She had a daughter which ended up being raised in a whore house. After the brother (little girls uncle) rescued the little girl, he went to give her a bath and she immediately tries to give him a bj because she was being sexually abused in the whore house. The uncle snaps, and goes to find the jerk who started it all and beats him to death with a pipe (?). In the end he plants a bomb in the girl's teddy bear and leaves it to blow a building up, but she sees the bear and runs to get it, killing her. I'm pretty sure the title was one word, and my head is going to ""monster"" or ""hope"", but I'm. Pretty sure monster is an anime and hope is a Korean film, while this one was German, Dutch, something along those lines.",1,,,,

I remember that it followed different characters who were all part of the same family. It was a dark comedy/drama if I recall correctly. What I remember is from the storyline of the grandfather of the family: In one scene he goes golfing with a buddy who then has a heart-attack. The grandfather is concerned about his own health and goes to a doctor. The doctor says he'll be all right as long as he eats less salt. Then later in the movie the grandfather is at a family dinner and they clearly show him taking the salt shaker and putting lots of salt on his food. Another storyline was about his teenage son awakening sexuality I think. Movie is probably from the 90s or 00s. I hope somebody knows the title. Can't remember actors or something else, sorry.

I think the movie or the scene I'm thinking of was in a small apartment. I saw this movie around 2006-2009, but i think it was a 70-90s movie. Im fairly certain the movie was colored but for whatever reason i remembered it as gray, perhaps just the quality of the movie. I wasn't a fan of non English movies when i was little so i'm pretty sure its an English speaking movie.

The audio was noisy in the movie's opening scene. It vanished from Netflix before I could find it again. The man had fair-ish skin and others in his village would tease him about being ""albino"". He never seemed to be able to hold down a job and was always flirting with women. He kept telling people that he is a ""good man"" and constantly complained everything to his wife, especially when she only put a few pieces of meat in his stew(?) Towards the end of the movie, his wife gives him **seven** pieces of meat for his meal and he's overwhelmed with joy, perhaps, like, ""Seven pieces of meat?? Why now, wife?! I can't believe this!"" His wife has a darker complexion and her family urges her not to get a divorce. There is also a side story about a neighbor/young woman being courted who wants money. A large **wrestling champ** is in love with her, but she wants the finer things in life. This movie was so terrible, but I watched it with my mom and we couldn't stop laughing at how outlandish the whole thing was from beginning to end. We constantly joke about how so and so ""is a good man"" and can never show anyone what we're referencing.",2,,,,

A cop is investigating a series of deaths of guys who all die of a heart attack while using their VR. (Cop kind of looks like Sam Shepard, he was lean and scruffy, may have been wearing a trench coat). His trick to knowing that he's NOT in a VR is that he asks his ex-wife the name of the lake where they met or had their first date (kind of like Leonardo Dicaprio's trick in Inception with the spinning top). Guys are all dying in the VR because instead of their requested VR experience (usually something lame like golf or whatever), they unexpectedly encounter a naked lady and die of heart attacks while in the process of getting it on with the naked lady. Naked lady doesn't know that she's inadvertently killing all these dudes while stripping down for VR (she's real). Scruffy cop gets arrested and placed within a VR (like Tom Cruise in Minority Report, apparently it keeps the incarcerated people calm/feeling like they're in real life) due to some BS related to him investigating the murders (someone high powered DOESN'T want him to find out the truth!). Partner breaks him out. Cop follows the clues to find out that all the guys are all connected: they were all members of a jury that decided against granting a sex change operation to a guy (who if I remember correctly is now a high powered guy who owns/runs the VR company). Right when the cop realizes this, the guy comes running out in full drag + terrible wig + red lipstick with a machine gun trying to mow down the cops (guy in drag looks very similar to William Dafoe in Boondock Saints when he's dressed in drag) I can't seem to find the title of this movie anywhere!!!

So here it goes: * It's from or around the 1986-1998 time period. * The scene in particular is played out in a large, unused old metropolitan building, probably in its main hall, maybe in a large room. The building itself is in a large US city, almost 100% sure it's New York. * Lighting of the scene (or my memory) resembles neo-noir pieces of the era I mentioned. * Main character goes alone and it turns out the antagonist is the devil himself or at least some kind of ancient deistic baddie. This one is for sure. * The scene is where the revelation happens, the audience does not know the full picture beforehand. * Seen the movie in the mid-2000's on non-premium cable in Central Europe, meaning that it can not possibly be newer than 2000-2001. * It's *not* Angel Heart, which was my father's suggestion, but stylistically might be similar. It's been bugging me for a while and hoping that the amazing powers of the people of this sub can help me.",1,,,,

The beginning shows a serial killer murdering a little girl's parents. The girl somehow survives the encounter. Years later the girl grew up to be a language tutor (not sure). She becomes intimate with the student she tutors. She snaps and goes on killing. It turns out that she was the one who killed the serial killer in the beginning and her memory was blocked – as explained by her psychiatrist. It's probably a low budget movie.,1,,,,

While at the hotel they keep seeing visions of their daughter who died by I think falling into a frozen lake or something?

I sat and watched with her for awhile and I don’t remember much other than a kinda chubby light skinned black guy finding a baby in a crevice of a cave. He tries to reach it but I think it does something really off so he starts to freak out. I think it’s implied that it kills and eats him, then cuts away to a group of people in a bigger, better lit portion of the same cave. They were probably stuck or lost judging from from how they kinda stood around. I might remember a curly redhead girl sitting on some rocks? Anyway, these big humanoid brown monsters with spiky teeth burst into their part of the cave and start attacking, and from there my mom flipped the channel. It terrified me for *years* but now that I’m older I’m mystified by that memory and am dying to know what it is.",1,,,,

Later, he meets a guy and tries showing off his small dot tattoo, but the other guy rips open his shirt and shows that he has a giant tattoo of a ship.

We watched it from the beginning but I can't remember the actors or the name of it. The plot is about a woman driving down a road and her car suddenly breaks down. Some guy (I think it was a trucker) stops and offers to give her a ride to the nearest town or something like that. She accepts and he stops to pump gas at one of those american gas stations where you go pay inside a little store. But it turned out that the guy was actually robbing the place and he pulls out a gun (I think he shoots the clerk). The woman then runs away and the man chases her. She runs inside some facility that is nearby where a scientist was testing a time traveling machine. She gets sent back in time to the point where her car breaks down and it starts all over again. The man stops and offers the ride, and she accepts trying to save the clerk from being shot. The time traveling part happens a couple of times during the movie as she doesn't get the plan right and has to run back into the facility to save herself. Has anyone seen this movie? Does anybody know what it's called? Just knowing that it existed and I'm not crazy would be enough. Thanks!",1,thanks?,,,

I saw a movie or TV Show a few months ago and can not remember the name anymore unfortunately.

There was one daughter that was very successful but she was always one-upped by the other daughter be it in art, work or life general. Their parents were also very demanding and expecting always a lot. I remember one scene where when the parents passed away the whole inheritance was given to the more alternative, ""smarter"" daughter. The main character got nothing.

I saw this when I was between 8 to 10 years old. So it would have been around 20 years ago. From what I remember the movie had the feel of being made in the late 80s or early 90s. In the scene that comes to mind there are numerous cyborgs being housed in a futuristic space ship type setting. It seemed as if humans were possibly being transformed into cyborgs. In the scene a man/cyborg enters the room and proceeds to pull out one of the cyborgs eyes. I remember this scene being very graphic and grossing me out at the time. During my google searching I found a lot of similarities to the movie Cuborg 2. I am almost certain it isn’t this movie though. The movie I saw does not match any of the characters or costumes and the plot seems different although similar. Any help would be greatly appreciated.,1,,,,

Basically its a cartoon about this boy who has a father whom is a dragon and a human mother. One night the dragon dad transformed into a human and made love to the mama and out comes this hybrid boy whom at about 16 developed these scales on his arms and finds out that he is half dragon. He can't become a full dragon but he can shift into a kind of hybrid of dragon and human. Also his dad is imprisoned for some reason and there are evil government people keeping him there for plot development ect.

Saw a horror movie on Netflix a few years back and can't find it or remember what its called right now. I spent some time looking through Netflix and couldn't find idk if they removed it or if i just missed it... I remember the movie had really bad ratings it had like a 1 star on Netflix and was about a couple or family or something that moved to a strange rural town and later they discover there are zombies or some weird mutant alien species living underneath the village. At the end of the movie I think a woman who got impregnated by one of the alien/zombies gives birth to an alien. The reason im looking for this shit is because I remember there was a scene in it where some guy bonks a goat on the head with a hammer or something and it had me laughing for like 6 minutes straight.

Came out before 2013-2014 I want to say. relatively recent based on filming technique (Late 90's to modern day.) English speaking, possibly American. Live Action, The movie wasn't a comedy (or if it was, it was a very dark comedy.) ______________________________________________ This one scene really stood out. The child, who is an adult or late teen, is mad at the father, I believe for remarrying so quickly or not mourning. The father almost breaks down in tears explaining his relationship with the mother/wife to who's kid (might be son.). He says that he loved her but she never loved him, but he convinced her to marry him in hopes that maybe one day she could learn to be happy with him. She is then diagnosed with a life threatening illness and he never leaves her side. He then says how he felt guilty, that he robbed her, because in the moments while she was dying, she was with someone she didn't love and never grew to. She never lashed out, or said it, but the father already knew. __________________________ I checked IMDB, Wiki, and even TVTropes for threads. It's a vague enough concept that falls into a lot of movies (mostly comedy) but I lack any specificity such as actors, exact quotes, or even an inkling of the title to narrow down my search Any help would be appreciated. Other clues that I may not be remembering correctly. The scene was set in the day, it was at small dinner table (maybe) could be home or restaurant.",1,,,,

Anyway, what I'm remembering is a scene in which a woman walks into her kitchen to find the microwave on and then something in it seems to explode covering the door window in what appears to be blood. It's implied that her a pet (a small dog I believe but it could have been a cat or rabbit or something) has been microwaved. I can't remember too clearly anything else that was going on but I'm pretty sure it was some kind of horror movie or episode of a show. I'm leaning more towards a TV episode.

There was an execution scene at the beginning where someone was strangled in a public square outside a castle for being a witch or an aldulturer or something. An evil priest guy was running the show. Somehow he grabs this woman and takes her to his giant nightmare castle and the rest of the movie is this guy trying to rescue her. In the castle there’s a whole shit show of torture and executions (probably heavily edited or mostly implied, it was network TV after all but it blew our 10 year-old mindholes). A guy was buried alive in a wall. Just bricked around him or something. Another scene involving burning peoples feet. Evil priest cuts the woman’s tongue off at one point. Guy and tongueless girl reunite at the end. My friend and I are now in our 30s and we’ve been talking about this EVER SINCE. “What WAS that movie?!” My god I would love to find it and watch it with her for her birthday this year.

She also notices a control animal (gerbil or hamster) is lying still in its enclosure. A man talks to her through an intercom to comfort her but she soon convulses and dies. At some point the scene cuts to show an air vent outside the building implying the virus has escaped. Later, a child finds a sick bird and picks it up and I believe this child too convulses and dies.

8150,8suqvt,tipofmytongue,"[TOMT] Prison breakout movie with British characters, released I think somewhere between 2001 - 2008",3,8suqvt,1,2018-06-21 21:26:05,SulemanH,"I saw this movie only once on TV, but wasn't able to watch it fully through. Next time I wanted to watch it, I had forgotten its name. If I had to guess, I'd say the movie was released somewhere between 2001 till 2008, but I'm simply not sure. The characters in the movie all have british accents, and it focuses on an elderly general (or some similar rank) being locked up in a military prison. I remember many parts vividly, so will discribe them as best I can. 1) When the main character is meeting with the prison warden, the warden turns out to be a fan of his, and proudly shows him his own private collection of military equipment like swords and maybe some guns (I'm just not sure). Then the warden leaves the room for a minute to get his autograph book for the main character's autograph. While he's gone, the main character basically tells the warden's assistant that the warden's collection of weapons shows how alienated he is from the actual fighting and war, because a real soldier would be haunted by the death and destruction that the weapons stand for, and thus would not be collecting them. The warden overhears this, and this is when the warden starts despising him and making life difficult for him. 2) At one point the warden gives the main character a special punishment, he basically has to move a huge pile of rocks from one place to another. Inmates make bets on how many he'll be able to do before he gives up (remember that he's quite an old guy). When he starts doing well, and people start losing their bets, someone trips him up and he hits his head. But then someone stands up for him and nobody disturbs him while he continues. By the time he reaches the last few rocks, everyone's cheering for him and pushing him on. The moment he's done with the last rock, he's told by the guards that he needs to move the rock pile back to where he moved it from, which is obviously a dick move orchestrated by the warden. 3) At another part, he helps all the other inmates finish building a sort of wall, which is a project all the inmates had been participating in. As the wall is nearly ready, the warden decides to demolish it, because it is bringing the inmates together, and he fears that they may revolt. As the guards order everyone to lay down, one of the inmates refuses (this inmate is one of the important side-characters) and is ""accidentally"" shot in the head by a guard who gets the order directly from the warden, resulting in the death of the inmate, and a major driving force of the main character for the rest of the movie. I hope this information is sufficient to get the name of this movie from somebody who's seen it and remembers its name. If not, I will try to recall some more parts and share those.",1,,,,

In either case, they exchange witty banter as she gets dressed. I'm quite sure she was very high. They eventually make it out of the home, which is some kind of large estate, and the son encounters his mother's driver, who he has killed while she isn't looking, as he was the one selling her drugs. The body is hidden, and they exit the estate. That's as much as I remember.",1,,,,

Next time I wanted to watch it, I had forgotten its name. If I had to guess, I'd say the movie was released somewhere between 2001 till 2008, but I'm simply not sure. The characters in the movie all have british accents, and it focuses on an elderly general (or some similar rank) being locked up in a military prison. I remember many parts vividly, so will discribe them as best I can. 1) When the main character is meeting with the prison warden, the warden turns out to be a fan of his, and proudly shows him his own private collection of military equipment like swords and maybe some guns (I'm just not sure). Then the warden leaves the room for a minute to get his autograph book for the main character's autograph. While he's gone, the main character basically tells the warden's assistant that the warden's collection of weapons shows how alienated he is from the actual fighting and war, because a real soldier would be haunted by the death and destruction that the weapons stand for, and thus would not be collecting them. The warden overhears this, and this is when the warden starts despising him and making life difficult for him. 2) At one point the warden gives the main character a special punishment, he basically has to move a huge pile of rocks from one place to another. Inmates make bets on how many he'll be able to do before he gives up (remember that he's quite an old guy). When he starts doing well, and people start losing their bets, someone trips him up and he hits his head. But then someone stands up for him and nobody disturbs him while he continues. By the time he reaches the last few rocks, everyone's cheering for him and pushing him on. The moment he's done with the last rock, he's told by the guards that he needs to move the rock pile back to where he moved it from, which is obviously a dick move orchestrated by the warden. 3) At another part, he helps all the other inmates finish building a sort of wall, which is a project all the inmates had been participating in. As the wall is nearly ready, the warden decides to demolish it, because it is bringing the inmates together, and he fears that they may revolt. As the guards order everyone to lay down, one of the inmates refuses (this inmate is one of the important side-characters) and is ""accidentally"" shot in the head by a guard who gets the order directly from the warden, resulting in the death of the inmate, and a major driving force of the main character for the rest of the movie. I hope this information is sufficient to get the name of this movie from somebody who's seen it and remembers its name. If not, I will try to recall some more parts and share those.",1,,,,

I tried googling some details but ""Lord of War"" from 2005 came up and that's not it, I think my brain may have combined the memories of two different movies from that class into one. The movie takes place somewhere in the Middle East. It's one of those movies that starts out switching back and forth between different characters lives until finally they all affect each other in some way. In one story, there was a woman set to be married to a (wealthy?) man in an arranged marriage, but she is in love with someone poor, and frequently sneaks out to meet him. There is another story about two men (possibly brothers?) who are working for an organization and supposed to detonate a suicide bomb in a populated area. I think I remember the bombing location as a 'town square' type of place with a large circular fountain. In the end, the bomb does get detonated, but one (or both) of them has serious second thoughts and wants to back out. At the time of the bomb detonating, the other man is in a truck. One of the two men is the man that the previously mentioned woman was in love with. She may be in the area when the bomb goes off? I thought there was also a story about an illegal arms dealer somewhere in the movie, but when I googled the details I remembered from that, I got ""Lord of War.""

It starts out with hideous alien being sent to Earth. The disgusting alien was a pet to it's alien master. I think all you see of the master is his wicked looking gauntlet that 'pets' the grotesque alien. The alien sent to Earth comes to a big house that's throwing a get together. The main characters are two teenage metal head/stoners. I don't remember much beyond the alien lords gauntlet, because at the end of the movie the main teenager had a similar punk-rock-like-leather-glove with studs on it... when the malformed alien sees it, it reminds it of it's master, and becomes docile to the teenager with the glove. Also the alien kills the parents and their guests, and puts their heads on it's tongues... and at one point the kids try to tell the adults something is going on, and they bust into the parents bedroom, and see a writhing mass under the sheets and the kids are disgusted. They the alien pokes on of the parents heads out from under the still convulsing covers and talks to the kids. Then another head and another appear and talk to the kids... something like, ""this is grown-up stuff, why are you always bothering us!"" Even writing this, it sounds like one of the strangest films.

Was this in the US? Claymation is technically a trademarked term by Will Vinton. Other stop motion techniques could be replacement animation or armature/puppet animation. A year would be helpful and country. There’s so little stop motion out there that some snooping around should get you close to the style and creator especially if it went to VHS. It definitely wasn’t Jan Svenkmeyer (sp) or the Brothers Quay? The Canadian film board funded a great deal of the animation that was viewed in the US in the 70s and 80s and 90s so it may have been Canadian especially if it was sort of odd and repackaged as a “kids” program.,2,,,,

He pals around around with the MC and often makes crude jokes. * Something bad happens to the coworker - Here is where it gets really vague... I feel like he either gets sick/dies, or gets fired from the company for doing something inappropriate (maybe stealing money from it?). Maybe he commits suicide after doing something bad?

I'm pretty sure it was a South American country, but I'm very vague on that. What I remember the most was the ending, which was depressing. A Catholic Mass is happening (there was a priest in full regalia, including a hat, carrying something) just as a group of people with rifles open fire. The camera shows the priest getting hit with bullets and going down, along with the participants of the Mass. I'm pretty sure they knew this massacre was coming but decided to hold their Mass anyway, in defiance of whoever it was who was going to start shooting. At the end, I think there was an historical note about how most - or all - of the people in this land/tribe were killed. It was some kind of bloody event in somewhat-recent history. Any thoughts? It *may* have happened in Mexico; I'm not sure. I only know that it happened in a Spanish- or Portuguese-speaking country, but the movie was in English.",2,,,,

Most of my searching pointed to this but then again searching on so little is difficult. The character from what I can remember is living his normal life (possibly supernatural powers involved, not sure). He’s then finds himself in a psych ward where he believes to have been placed mistakenly. He tries to reason with them but they believe him to be crazy of course. After he’s stuck in there for some significant amount of time, it turns out he was stuck in a powerful mind illusion constructed by the enemy person/faction from his real life. He might have been broken free by a girl, again not sure. I realize this isn’t a whole lot to go on but I do believe the movie/show to have been made in the last 5 years if that helps. Thanks in advance to those who can help out. Edit: Typo",1,thanks?,,,
