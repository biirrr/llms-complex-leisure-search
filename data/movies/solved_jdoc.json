I have a clear memory of a movie I watched when I was a teen (I was born in 1971 BTW), so it probably came out in the mid/late 80s. It was about a woman who falls in love with an older man. She wasn't a YOUNG woman, maybe she was a divorcee? Maybe she had teenage or even adult kids?? (not too sure about that part) What I do remember is that there is enough of a difference in their ages (and the man is the older one) that it is a significant issue to her friends or family, like maybe she's in her early 40s and he's in his late 60's? (In my memory he was even older than that, but I'm thinking I watched this when I was 15 or 16, which means any man who was over 50 probably seemed ANCIENT to me.) I remember a love scene between them, maybe toward the end of the movie, that at the time kind of shocked me because he was so much older. Anyway, I don't remember many details of the plot, except that maybe much of the movie took place in a high rise apartment? I always thought I remembered the main characters being played by Jane Fonda and James Garner...and because I thought it was James Garner, I always thought it was Murphy's Romance. however, I just watched 5 minutes of that, and I KNOW it isn't Murphy's Romance, because that appears to take place on a horse ranch, and I clearly recall that this movie took place in a city. I looked through the films starring Jane Fonda and James Garner, and nothing looks right. I feel like I'd know the movie instantly if I saw the title. Can you help me remember? One final odd flash of memory that might or might not be relevant: I feel like either the title of the film or the name of one of the main characters had something to do with a little song or nursery rhyme that appears in the movie at some point.

Hello all, I am hoping someone here can help me remember the title of a movie that I watched back in the late 90's or early 2000's. I may have asked this here before and gotten the answer but I seemed to have note written it down or e-mailed it to myself so I apologize in advance if that is the case. Either way though I would really like to know which movie this is. Also I apologize in advance for the length of the post but I wanted to give as many details as I can remember to hopefully make it easier for someone to ID this movie. Okay, enough pre-lim this is what I remember of the film: Pretty sure I watched it in the late 90's, late at night on a cable station. Perhaps Cinemax or Showtime but I cannot say for certain which station. I know it had to be the late 90's and I am pretty sure it was late at night because it had the feel of one of those \"\"almost\"\" a soft core movie feels to it. It starts off in a doctor's office. There is a woman getting examined there but you know something is not right because the lighting is kinda dark and \"\"spooky\"\" and also the music as I recall is a bit ominous/suspenseful. Anyway, the male doctor molests/rapes the woman and then I believe kills her because she \"\"wakes up\"\" as he is doing it. The scene then shifts to the woman's sister, who might be a cop or more likely a reporter. The sister then decides to go undercover and find out what is happening at this clinic because she does not feel her sister's death was an accident, etc. The whole clinic has this weird cult like vibe to it and the lighting as I recall really helps portray this feeling of tension. There might be one of those \"\"experimental\"\" treatment angles going on with the clinic too which is why the regular cops don't want to get involved. I feel like the doctor either drugged or hypnotized the victims so they would not wake up or remember what happened to them. Somehow or another there is also a man involved in investigating the clinic. I cannot remember if he is the dead woman or the sister's boyfriend or just a cop but I know he gets involved and helps the sister get out and expose the doctor and his nurse (who I think is his wife or something who helps him molest these woman who come into the clinic). The man also ends up falling in love with the sister as I recall as well (shocking I know). There was just this over all kinda creepy vibe to the movie with this underlying sexual tension that makes it stick in my mind. Any help at all would be greatly appreciated.

Hello all, I am hoping someone here can help me remember the title of a movie that I watched back in the late 90's or early 2000's. I may have asked this here before and gotten the answer but I seemed to have note written it down or e-mailed it to myself so I apologize in advance if that is the case. Either way though I would really like to know which movie this is. Also I apologize in advance for the length of the post but I wanted to give as many details as I can remember to hopefully make it easier for someone to ID this movie. Okay, enough pre-lim this is what I remember of the film: Pretty sure I watched it in the late 90's, late at night on a cable station. Perhaps Cinemax or Showtime but I cannot say for certain which station. I know it had to be the late 90's and I am pretty sure it was late at night because it had the feel of one of those \"\"almost\"\" a soft core movie feels to it. It starts off in a doctor's office. There is a woman getting examined there but you know something is not right because the lighting is kinda dark and \"\"spooky\"\" and also the music as I recall is a bit ominous/suspenseful. Anyway, the male doctor molests/rapes the woman and then I believe kills her because she \"\"wakes up\"\" as he is doing it. The scene then shifts to the woman's sister, who might be a cop or more likely a reporter. The sister then decides to go undercover and find out what is happening at this clinic because she does not feel her sister's death was an accident, etc. The whole clinic has this weird cult like vibe to it and the lighting as I recall really helps portray this feeling of tension. There might be one of those \"\"experimental\"\" treatment angles going on with the clinic too which is why the regular cops don't want to get involved. I feel like the doctor either drugged or hypnotized the victims so they would not wake up or remember what happened to them. Somehow or another there is also a man involved in investigating the clinic. I cannot remember if he is the dead woman or the sister's boyfriend or just a cop but I know he gets involved and helps the sister get out and expose the doctor and his nurse (who I think is his wife or something who helps him molest these woman who come into the clinic). The man also ends up falling in love with the sister as I recall as well (shocking I know). There was just this over all kinda creepy vibe to the movie with this underlying sexual tension that makes it stick in my mind. Any help at all would be greatly appreciated.
