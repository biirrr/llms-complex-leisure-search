(B) freaks out and leaves after seeing (A)'s bizarre childish behavior. (A) later calls (B) and, (B) tells him that he can visit them after they return from their trip. There was never a trip and it was all to avoid any future tinglings. (A) visit's (B), and gives him a collage of their photos. Later, (B) tells him they have moved on, and things cannot be the way they were and asks (A) to leave and don't come to see him again. Towards the end of the movie, (A) learns to move on. At (B)'s wedding party, one of the guests tells (A), \"\"good cake\"\" and (A) replies \"\"yeah, I like wedding cakes. They are sweet\"\". It's an American movie. I appreciate anyone who can identify it. Thanks to MrsRonSwanson the movie is now solved.

The actor is a man who doesn't look to be that old in his 30s and what I can remember was that he was a very good shooter as I remember he was laying down in the snow so he would not be seen from the many people who were trying to kill him and he shoots a man from a long ways off using his sight in the hand and makes a hole in his hand. The man who got shot looks at his hand and starts laughing and I think there was a helicopter and a few other people with the man that got shot. The movie is only approximately 3 4 or 5 years old I think and during the movie the guy is getting chased by people trying to kill him. The guy getting chased is an expert rifle shooter. If anyone knows the name of the actor or the movie please let me know. Thanks\"\n\nPlease provide a ranked list of your 20 best guesses for the correct answer.

Hey.

Then, when her parent(s) left and she was by her self this man drives up to her house who looks like a greaser or something with along with this big (bald?) guy in the driver's seat, who I think had on sunglasses and never spoke a word. The greaser guy gets out and says to her promiscuous things and shows her a number on his car (69?) that had a sexual meaning and tell her to get in to show her a good time or something (she was obviously a virgin). He then takes her to this grass field and, although it shows nothing, you can obviously tell what he was doing with her there (He didn't rape her as it was consensual, I think). That's all I remember. I don't know if the movie shares the same title as the short story, though. additionally, it looked like a Strait-To-video movie or a TV-Only movie with an extremely low budget and it looked like it was made in the 90s.

Then, when her parent(s) left and she was by her self this man drives up to her house who looks like a greaser or something with along with this big (bald?) guy in the driver's seat, who I think had on sunglasses and never spoke a word. The greaser guy gets out and says to her promiscuous things and shows her a number on his car (69?) that had a sexual meaning and tell her to get in to show her a good time or something (she was obviously a virgin). He then takes her to this grass field and, although it shows nothing, you can obviously tell what he was doing with her there (He didn't rape her as it was consensual, I think). That's all I remember. I don't know if the movie shares the same title as the short story, though. additionally, it looked like a Strait-To-video movie or a TV-Only movie with an extremely low budget and it looked like it was made in the 90s. In fact, I think it was a short film. Any thoughts? \"\"They're all your hats, Mr. Angier.\"\"\"\n\nPlease provide a ranked list of your 20 best guesses for the correct answer.

He opens the front door with his Hitler moustache on, making everybody in the bar suprised and frightened. At that moment he loudly asks the people \"\"Am I in America?\"\" or \"\"Is this America?\"\".

Gets kicked off the team somehow, or maybe quits and goes back home to the country and builds an \"\"American made\"\" motorcycle to race his rival in a big race. They rehire Fuj to help tune their bike. They show up to the race with the bike in a horse trailer and the guard says \"\"this ain't no horse race\"\" to which they reply \"\"this ain't no horse\"\". In the end, the team rider ends up blowing his motor in the final lap and the hero of course wins on his \"\"American Made\"\" bike. I remember lots of the plot, I just can't find it on imdb using any of this info !?! :-( One of the characters reminds me a lot of Bill Paxton, but I looked at his entire filmography and I couldn't find it so maybe it was my imagination.

One of the guys tries to attack one of the things and all their wings are open, when he charges one of the creatures it closes its wings and sucks him dry and just a goo (maybe glowing green or something) falls at the creatures feet.

I saw this film in Belgium when I was younger - let's say early '90s, but it could very well be older. I have no general memories about the movie, except that it COULD be a comedy (very possible i'm mistaken though). The scene I remember goes as follows: There's this knight in black armor. I do think he's \"\"the bad guy\"\". Someone tries to behead him (i think the hero). Instead of falling to the ground, his head sort of comes out of his armor (slowly). He's laughing (in a sinister manner) and I believe he had rather long grayish hair. So it seems he wasn't beheaded - he just had his helmet knocked off. I'm not sure about what happens next, but I think the hero just hacks off the real head as well. (could be I'm making this up though). Anyone have any idea?

(Brake (2012)). Hello everyone, This is my first time posting here, so pardon me if this has been asked before or if I am doing this wrong. I need help finding the name of a movie or TV series. I don't remember exactly which one it was. I saw a youtube video the other day that involved the movie Buried with Ryan Reynolds and it somewhat reminded me of it. Ok, here is what I remember: It involves a man who has been kidnapped and locked in a chest in the back of a truck. The driver randomly opens a little hole and either tases him or I believe releases bees inside. They give him a cell phone and they want some information from him. They had supposedly kidnapped his wife and was using her as leverage. They wanted access codes or a location. He is finally \"\"rescued\"\" after enough torture and it was all supposedly a training exercise with everything being faked, and his wife being in on it. They put him in an ambulance and he actually tells his wife that the code had something to do with her. Then she smiles and leaves the ambulance, and he finds out it wasn't fake. The end. Now, I am not fully sure of whether all of those facts are correct, as they might be from another TV episode or movie. Here are a couple of events that I think also happened in the episode or movie: - I think it was a terrorist attack that was launched and they kidnapped important people, the guy being one of them. -There were supposedly some explosions all over the city, as they were under attack. - He was able to talk to a couple other people on the cell phone while captured, maybe another agent that was also in on it with the wife and bad guys. -Most of the episode/movie is spent with the guy locked inside this chest, which I believe was clear and had a tube that led to the driver (Which is how he was zapped and the bees or whatever were put inside with him). And thats all I remember. I had about 1.5 TB of an external HD filled with movies and TV series, but it ended up taking a crap a couple years ago.

SOLVED: The answer is Night of Courage (1987). Thanks to a_l_i_e_n. I saw a TV movie in 1985 about a street gang that terrorizes a neighborhood. One of the main characters was an old white man who lived in a house, NOT an apartment building. The neighborhood was NOT the type with tall run-down apartment buildings that is usually seen in these type of movies. The street gang looked like the sterotypical street gang you only see in 80's movies: bandanas, denim cut off jackets, multi-ethnic. I distinctly remember a scene where the gang chases a teenager. He had no shoes on - I assume the gang took them - and he had to run over broken glass in the street to get away from them. I think they might have caught him and hurt him really bad or he might have gotten hit by a car. In the final scene, the neighbors manage to run the gang out of the neighborhood. I don't remember exactly how they did it. But the final scene is the old man yelling out his window something \"\"Yeah, get outta here!\"\" or \"\"We got ya!\"\" or words to that effect. The closing credits were over a freeze frame of the man's house. The gang was not arrested they just ran away. I remember my father telling me \"\"They could just come back anyway\"\".

His family got used to his games as well as to his eccentricity and withdrawal. In the course of the movie, the boy gets to know an older homeless-like woman who is not less bizarre. The woman could readily enter a shop to steel money or shoplift...and could go out to drive away in any available car to escape in a very clumsy way. As a non skilled driver, the woman may hit a parking car while making a turn or may hit an other parking car while driving in a hardly straight path. The boy said in an occasion' I miss suicide'. The boy and the woman developed a kind of close relation as they find many things in common. The boy eventually asked the woman to be his wife. Some one in the movie criticized 'how could you marry an old lady with sagging breasts'. I wish someone could recall the name of that movie. Thanks.

Hi all, Years ago I remember seeing a trailer for a film that I intended to see, but I forgot the title before I watched it and have never managed to track it down again. I'm hoping someone can help me figure it out. Here's what I recall: Main plot: A young woman is diagnosed with a major mental illness, such as schizophrenia. I believe she may have been hospitalized at times because of this. Maybe at the start of the film, she has managed to gain a bit of stability using prescription medication. She meets a young man and they fall passionately in love. They want so badly to have a \"\"normal\"\" life and family. Either she gets pregnant unexpectedly, or they PLAN to have a baby, and she is absolutely thrilled. However, because of the pregnancy, she is forced to stop taking her meds (because they would harm the child), which causes her to become severely psychotic. She either has the baby taken from her by the authorities or she is forced to fight with everything she has to prove that she can care for the child, because the authorities believe she is a danger to the child. I believe the story was told in a very dramatic manner and was very sad because they loved each other and the child so much and tried so hard to do what is best for the child. Other relevant facts: The movie was in color and I *think* the actors spoke English (though I'm not positive about that, because I do watch a lot of foreign films with subtitles). I believe I saw the trailer sometime between 1996 - 2004. At the time that I saw the trailer, I think it was already out on video. The film did not seem outdated to me, so I believe it was probably made no earlier than 1985, but probably more like a mid-to-late 90's or even early 2000's. When I try to remember the title or main actors, I always come back to the movie Crazy/Beautiful with Kirsten Dunst (although I am positive it is NOT that film). Not sure if the name of my film was similar, if it came out at approximately the same time as Crazy/Beautiful, or if the main actress reminded me of Dunst...or maybe there is no good reason for me to think of Crazy/Beautiful at all.
