I may have asked this here before and gotten the answer but I seemed to have note written it down or e-mailed it to myself so I apologize in advance if that is the case.  Either way though I would really like to know which movie this is.  Also I apologize in advance for the length of the post but I wanted to give as many details as I can remember to hopefully make it easier for someone to ID this movie. Okay, enough pre-lim this is what I remember of the film:  Pretty sure I watched it in the late 90's, late at night on a cable station.  Perhaps Cinemax or Showtime but I cannot say for certain which station.  I know it had to be the late 90's and I am pretty sure it was late at night because it had the feel of one of those \"almost\" a soft core movie feels to it.  It starts off in a doctor's office.  There is a woman getting examined there but you know something is not right because the lighting is kinda dark and \"spooky\" and also the music as I recall is a bit ominous/suspenseful.  Anyway, the male doctor molests/rapes the woman and then I believe kills her because she \"wakes up\" as he is doing it.  The scene then shifts to the woman's sister, who might be a cop or more likely a reporter.  The sister then decides to go undercover and find out what is happening at this clinic because she does not feel her sister's death was an accident, etc.    The whole clinic has this weird cult like vibe to it and the lighting as I recall really helps portray this feeling of tension.  There might be one of those \"experimental\" treatment angles going on with the clinic too which is why the regular cops don't want to get involved.  I feel like the doctor either drugged or hypnotized the victims so they would not wake up or remember what happened to them.     Somehow or another there is also a man involved in investigating the clinic.  I cannot remember if he is the dead woman or the sister's boyfriend or just a cop but I know he gets involved and helps the sister get out and expose the doctor and his nurse (who I think is his wife or something who helps him molest these woman who come into the clinic).  The man also ends up falling in love with the sister as I recall as well (shocking I know).    There was just this over all kinda creepy vibe to the movie with this underlying sexual tension that makes it stick in my mind.  Any help at all would be greatly appreciated.

I may have asked this here before and gotten the answer but I seemed to have note written it down or e-mailed it to myself so I apologize in advance if that is the case.  Either way though I would really like to know which movie this is.  Also I apologize in advance for the length of the post but I wanted to give as many details as I can remember to hopefully make it easier for someone to ID this movie. Okay, enough pre-lim this is what I remember of the film:  Pretty sure I watched it in the late 90's, late at night on a cable station.  Perhaps Cinemax or Showtime but I cannot say for certain which station.  I know it had to be the late 90's and I am pretty sure it was late at night because it had the feel of one of those \"almost\" a soft core movie feels to it.  It starts off in a doctor's office.  There is a woman getting examined there but you know something is not right because the lighting is kinda dark and \"spooky\" and also the music as I recall is a bit ominous/suspenseful.  Anyway, the male doctor molests/rapes the woman and then I believe kills her because she \"wakes up\" as he is doing it.  The scene then shifts to the woman's sister, who might be a cop or more likely a reporter.  The sister then decides to go undercover and find out what is happening at this clinic because she does not feel her sister's death was an accident, etc.    The whole clinic has this weird cult like vibe to it and the lighting as I recall really helps portray this feeling of tension.  There might be one of those \"experimental\" treatment angles going on with the clinic too which is why the regular cops don't want to get involved.  I feel like the doctor either drugged or hypnotized the victims so they would not wake up or remember what happened to them.     Somehow or another there is also a man involved in investigating the clinic.  I cannot remember if he is the dead woman or the sister's boyfriend or just a cop but I know he gets involved and helps the sister get out and expose the doctor and his nurse (who I think is his wife or something who helps him molest these woman who come into the clinic).  The man also ends up falling in love with the sister as I recall as well (shocking I know).    There was just this over all kinda creepy vibe to the movie with this underlying sexual tension that makes it stick in my mind.  Any help at all would be greatly appreciated.

He finds the Gallery - and Natalie Wood - and starts negotiating for the painting AND falling in love with her. His airborne angels figure this little quirk in the deal out and maneuver everything so everyone gets what they want. Can anybody be of help in this search? SOLVED!

The King is making no move to get rid of the dragon so they take the initiative.    The peasants seek the aid of an old wizard for help.  Just as the wizard is packing up to help, one of the King's men shows up and kills the wizard.  Why, I don't know.  Perhaps the King is afraid of rocking the boat and provoking the dragon?    The amulet that is the source of the wizard's power passes to his Apprentice who instead offers his services.  On their way to the dragon's cave the Apprentice discovers that the young man leading the group of peasants is actually a young woman.  Her parents hid her gender so she would not be taken as a sacrifice.    When they arrive at the cave the Apprentice causes a rockslide to seal the cave.  The entire village celebrates and during the celebrations the young woman finally drops the ruse and dons a dress for the celebrations.  However the King is not pleased.  He has the Apprentice brought to his castle where he takes the amulet and locks him up.

He opens the front door with his Hitler moustache on, making everybody in the bar suprised  and frightened. At that moment he loudly asks the people \"Am I in America?\" or \"Is this America?\".

There is only once scene I remember, which is, if I'm correct, somewhere towards the end of the film:  A man gets dressed up as Hitler to escape (possibly Europe). If my memory is good, he steals a plane and successfully escapes, but either the plane crashes or malfunctions which forces him to land. He survives, and finds a motel or some kind of bar nearby. He opens the front door with his Hitler moustache on, making everybody in the bar suprised  and frightened. At that moment he loudly asks the people \"Am I in America?\" or \"Is this America?\". Two smaller notes: - The plane might have crashed into the bar as well, and not next to it. - I've seen this dubbed, but I don't think the line can be much different in the original version. It's most probably an English speaking film, but could be French as well.  I hope that the whole thing's not too vague, and that someone can indentify the movie in question.

But later when Liz suspiciously looks into the basket, she's not there... someone has moved the body.  Its revealed that the boyfriend (Liz's or the murdered girl's) is the culprit and as Liz tries to make her getaway in a car the murdered girls body falls into view. It was hidden in the car.

Half the kids die before they get picked up by a chopper in the end. All the cast is asian, but I believe the movie is from the US. I cant remember if they spoke english or vietnamese(only remeber the subtitles.)   I have spent many hours on the net searching for these, but no luck. Any help is highly appreciated. :)", "solved": true, "thread_id": "227449793", "title": "The Hunter", "year": "2011"}, {"confirmed": true, "prompt": "Identify the movie the user is looking for as described in the request below:\n\nRequest: \"I saw this soap opera when i was a kid.It was aired in the late 90's or at the beggining of the year 2000.I do not remember much but all i know is that the main character was a gypsy girl with dark and wavy/curly hair who fells in love with a rich man.I hole there is someone out there who could help me.Thank you.:)\"\n\nPlease provide a ranked list of your 20 best guesses for the correct answer.

When the couple try to tell him it is over he points behind them and the couple are horrified to learn that the entire police force were friends of the old man.  It looked like John and Jane would be trapped in hell again when all of a sudden something underground started to explode and the ground started to fall out beneath everyone's feet.  John and Jane escape as almost everyone else is killed.  The movie ends with John waking up in front of a TV that's reporting the aftermath of the explosions.  A reporter questions one of the survivors and it is revealed to be the old man.  He claims he is going to stay with \"relatives\" now.  The old man has John's driver's license, flashing it in front of the TV camera and showing off to John that he knows where he lives.  A horrified John runs straight through a wall and leaves a human shaped hole.

As I remember it, the \"scenes\" included one or two dancers, male and female, in regular ballet costumes (tights, leotards, tutus), and the filming was against a black or dark background, and the dance costumes were either white or light.  Can anyone tell me the name of the short, the music, the dance company, and most importantly, is this short available anywhere?  It was a wonderful film, and one that I still remember 44 or 45 years later.

Basically what I remember (however accurate said memory might be) of it is a scene where a couple invites someone into their house.  I think they know him, but don't really know.  They end up standing in the kitchen and the wife turns around and goes to get the guest coffee or water or something, when he shoots her in the back.  Then he turns and shoots the husband.  At that point, somewhere else in the house, their kid (I think it was a boy) goes and hides in a closet, where I think the murderer finds him and kidnaps him?    Honestly, I'm not sure about the last part, because I'm pretty sure that 7-10 year old me was mostly hiding under blankets at that point, so I'm not sure how much I actually remember and how much my brain has just filled in.

My Kendo Sensei recommended this movie to me, the title is supposedly \"Enemy Mine\" but I found no such title with that plot within the site.

The plt is about a (gorgeous) blonde girl that claims to be back from the future and leads a very little sect of people devoted to her. If i'm not mistaken ther's some kind of connection with the moon either in the title or in the plot. There's a guy that start to be part of the sect together with his girlfriend, with the intention to study this phenomenon of the sects, for the university i guess. Quickly he gets involved (never physically with her) and start to believe the blonde. Her final request is to bring her a little girl, which she seems to be connected to, as a proof of loyalty.
