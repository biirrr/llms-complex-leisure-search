226398201	movie	jdoc-annotated	imdb	1980's movie about an 'september/december' romance??--SOLVED!. I have a clear memory of a movie I watched when I was a teen (I was born in 1971 BTW), so it probably came out in the mid/late 80s. It was about a woman who falls in love with an older man. She wasn't a YOUNG woman, maybe she was a divorcee? Maybe she had teenage or even adult kids?? (not too sure about that part) What I do remember is that there is enough of a difference in their ages (and the man is the older one) that it is a significant issue to her friends or family, like maybe she's in her early 40s and he's in his late 60's? (In my memory he was even older than that, but I'm thinking I watched this when I was 15 or 16, which means any man who was over 50 probably seemed ANCIENT to me.) I remember a love scene between them, maybe toward the end of the movie, that at the time kind of shocked me because he was so much older. Anyway, I don't remember many details of the plot, except that maybe much of the movie took place in a high rise apartment? I always thought I remembered the main characters being played by Jane Fonda and James Garner...and because I thought it was James Garner, I always thought it was Murphy's Romance. however, I just watched 5 minutes of that, and I KNOW it isn't Murphy's Romance, because that appears to take place on a horse ranch, and I clearly recall that this movie took place in a city. I looked through the films starring Jane Fonda and James Garner, and nothing looks right. I feel like I'd know the movie instantly if I saw the title. Can you help me remember? One final odd flash of memory that might or might not be relevant: I feel like either the title of the film or the name of one of the main characters had something to do with a little song or nursery rhyme that appears in the movie at some point. Am I totally off on that, or does that trigger someone else's memory?? Thanks in advance for any input. :)
227932805	movie	jdoc-annotated	imdb	Late 60s TV show or movie--Horror SOLVED!. I saw this on TV when I was little (under 9). It was probably something like Night Gallery, but I haven't been able to find the episode, if it was. The scene begins with a young woman waking up or something. She immediately looks frightened, and there's suspenseful music. She walks slowly through the apartment (or house, I guess, but I thought it was in a high rise). She's wearing a nightgown, white, I think. She comes to an open door where there's a mural painted on the wall. It has a dark background, and a man's figure is painted, all white, no details of clothing, no face. As she nears the painting, obviously terrified, and the music building, the figure slowly comes out of the painting and its face materializes. He is still white from head to toe, but his eyes appear (heavy eye liner) and then his mouth appears, very, very red lips. She runs out, screaming. After that, he opens his eyes and laughs. My dad was watching this, and I was so scared I ran to the TV and changed the channel. He made me switch it back. (""Don't be such a baby, it's not real"") I believe that someone (or an organization) was trying to drive the woman insane, and by the end, I don't think they were successful. In 40 years, I have never forgotten the image of the guy coming out of the painting, and I would love to see it again. I'm sure it's not that scary, but I was only around six or seven.
227361963	movie	jdoc-annotated	imdb	Woman creates a fake husband who died in 9/11 attacks SOLVED. A documentary, probably around 3-4 years old, about a woman who made up a husband and said he died in the Twin Towers collapse. She started joining various support groups and ended up leading pretty much everything she was involved in, even getting one guy thrown out of the leader role in the group he started. The documentary features people that met and knew the woman explaining how she became so involved, what she was like etc. From what I can remember, she became very demanding of s group of her closest 'friends' from the support groups, and would cut out anyone who questioned her or her story. I think they might have even gone back to her high school classmates and found that she was doing similar stuff then. Anyone know the title? Thanks in advance guys! Born from an egg on a mountain top

227010364	movie	jdoc-annotated	imdb	French movie about drama theatre SOLVED. I have recently remembered of a movie i saw in the 90's mid to late 90's in colour and in the french language with english subtitles. I remember it was about a woman who in a town or city, joins a theatre group, she originally may have been a prostitute or something like that a poor girl. The movie was a time piece set in a time were i think their were carriages instead of cars. I remember that eventually this woman falls in love with one of the guys that organise the theatre play shows. She eventually becomes a very big hit and all the rich people want to see her act and watch the show. Eventually after a few time jumps she has kids with the man from the theatre. She then gets sick, and she can barely act anymore she thinks that the theatre show won't be able to go on, but the girl that does her make up says she has learnt all the womans lines throughout the years and is sure she could pull it off. The woman feels betrayed by the theatre people and i remember her saying a line near the end of the movie once she was replaced by the girl who did her make up or wardrobe. The woman says something along the lines "" To act is to die every night on stage"" something philosophical like that. anyone recognise this movie? thanks for your help ahead of time.

226362459	movie	jdoc-annotated	imdb	SOLVED. 90's or early 2000's thriller/suspense movie. Hello all, I am hoping someone here can help me remember the title of a movie that I watched back in the late 90's or early 2000's. I may have asked this here before and gotten the answer but I seemed to have note written it down or e-mailed it to myself so I apologize in advance if that is the case. Either way though I would really like to know which movie this is. Also I apologize in advance for the length of the post but I wanted to give as many details as I can remember to hopefully make it easier for someone to ID this movie. Okay, enough pre-lim this is what I remember of the film: Pretty sure I watched it in the late 90's, late at night on a cable station. Perhaps Cinemax or Showtime but I cannot say for certain which station. I know it had to be the late 90's and I am pretty sure it was late at night because it had the feel of one of those ""almost"" a soft core movie feels to it. It starts off in a doctor's office. There is a woman getting examined there but you know something is not right because the lighting is kinda dark and ""spooky"" and also the music as I recall is a bit ominous/suspenseful. Anyway, the male doctor molests/rapes the woman and then I believe kills her because she ""wakes up"" as he is doing it. The scene then shifts to the woman's sister, who might be a cop or more likely a reporter. The sister then decides to go undercover and find out what is happening at this clinic because she does not feel her sister's death was an accident, etc. The whole clinic has this weird cult like vibe to it and the lighting as I recall really helps portray this feeling of tension. There might be one of those ""experimental"" treatment angles going on with the clinic too which is why the regular cops don't want to get involved. I feel like the doctor either drugged or hypnotized the victims so they would not wake up or remember what happened to them. Somehow or another there is also a man involved in investigating the clinic. I cannot remember if he is the dead woman or the sister's boyfriend or just a cop but I know he gets involved and helps the sister get out and expose the doctor and his nurse (who I think is his wife or something who helps him molest these woman who come into the clinic). The man also ends up falling in love with the sister as I recall as well (shocking I know). There was just this over all kinda creepy vibe to the movie with this underlying sexual tension that makes it stick in my mind. Any help at all would be greatly appreciated.

200505171	movie	jdoc-annotated	imdb	Here are two tough ones, I'm afraid. (One solved, one still unsolved). 1: I made a thread about this one some years ago (some regulars might even still remember it), but despite that I kept bumping it for months, it never really got solved (some suggestions looked promissing, but I was unable to find out for sure), so I think I'll give it another try. Either way, it was a movie (or a TV series) about a boy, who lived in a palace, because his father was a trusted employee of a king. Both the boy and his father wore wigs, so I guess it was the 18th century? I only remember one scene, where the father tells the boy: ""I have two masters: God and the king. But you have three masters: God, the king and me."" I don't know exactly how long ago it was, that I saw this movie (or mini series), but it was several years ago. In fact, I think it must have been in the 1990s. It's not: * ""Amadeus"" * ""The madness of king George"" * ""Little Lord Fauntleroy"" * ""The prince and the pauper"" * ""Longitudes"" * ""Immortal beloved"" * ""The whipping boy"" It could be (even though I doubt it): * ""Farinelli"" * ""A clandestine marriage"". 2: I'm also taking the opportunity to search for a song, that must have come out in 2000 or 2001. In the music video, the singer (a blonde girl) sang while standing up in a small boat. I believe the lyrics might have contained the words ""a love without compare"". It's not: * ""The constant"" by I blame Coco * ""Lovefool"" by the Cardigans It is: * ""Every time you need me"" by Fragma Intelligence and purity.

The alien looks vaguely like Broderick Crawford, if I remember right. At one point he's chasing someone in a car, and he somehow sends the message ""you can't get away from me,"" or something similar. I saw it only once, around the 60's or early 70's, and it was pretty memorable, so I'd love to know what the name of it was. ""Extremism in the pursuit of moderation is no vice.""

225883415	movie	jdoc-annotated	imdb	Erotic film, some incest - SOLVED.

At the end of the film they join the girl's brother in a threesome. There might have been tents involved somewhere (tents set up in the living room?), I think their parents were rich with a big house and may have been away when the incest bit happened. They were privileged kids basically. I think they were British but I might be wrong. There might have been a bit where he shaves her, but I might be mixing that bit up with another film, and if I am I'd quite like to know what that film is too please! Many thanks.

226220772	movie	jdoc-annotated	imdb	SOLVED: 70's/early 80's film with a public sword cutting/slicing?. i believe it's the very last scene in the movie. i don't remember the specific year i saw this, but it would have been earlier than 1985 for sure. the only scene i remember was someone being executed for something, in a public square type space. the character was tied to a post, and the executioner had a long, curved sword which they drew over the victim's chest, cutting and letting blood come out. this was done repeatedly until the victim was completely bloody but still alive. a literal ""death by 1000 cuts"" if you will. there was another character--perhaps the main character in the film?--off in the distance, and this person was setting up rifle. they then shot the execution victim, killing him. i remember my dad telling me that the shooter was friends with the victim, and shot him because he didn't want to suffer any longer. any idea what film this could be? i believe it was in color, but i could be mistaken. thanks!
