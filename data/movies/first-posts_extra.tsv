206817134	movie	extra	imdb	Sci-Fi Movie Question. Hey I'm helping a friend to try to get the name of a movie that's sorta like Logan's Run. She discusses it in this thread here: http://movies.groups.yahoo.com/group/sciencefictiongroup/message/78020 It's not 'Wedlock', that movie was only mentioned because it had elements that would remind one of it but the movie in question is older than Wedlock, probably by about 10 years.
217689875	movie	extra	imdb	Action/Thriller movie, Prob. early 90s. I saw this movie like 10 years ago as a kid, it's about some family getting stalked by some maniac, I think the opening scene is set in a bar where we see the bad guy, iirc he had a beard or a moustache, and light brown/blonde hair. It's hard to remember specifics but I think shortly afterwards there's some kind of flashback involving a car (blue? possibly upside down) with a broken windshield that has blood on it. In the end this stalker dies from getting hit by a truck on the highway, after he'd been chasing the mother and daughter, at one point I think they escaped him in a dark van. A few other things I remember: The mother and daughter is home, and they hear the door closing, they think it's the father but it turns out to be the stalker, a fight happens, he is hit by a lamp and they escape. The stalker is watching the daughter at a swimming pool, don't remember much other than this. I've tried asking on other forums before without luck, the movie is probably old, could be from the 80s but I'd put my bet on early 90s. :D

223302474	movie	extra	imdb	OT (sorta) looking for a short story I read when I was younger. I don't remember much about it except it was very fairy-tale like, but fairly creepy. There were these two girls that lived with their mother and I THINK they were very disobedient. There's an old lady or a witch who shows up to their door one day and she has a music box that the girls want, I THINK (memory is so vague). And in the end I THINK one or both of them end up being put into the music box when the mother returns from a trip... http://myvideogamelog.blogspot.ca/
224202746	movie	extra	imdb	Two coming of age dramas.. 1) This is from the '90s, I think. It's about a mom and her 2 teen daughters. The oldest is always dating guys who convince her they're nice and she believes them. She meets a guy and this one seems to really be nice. They have sex and he dissapears, making her loose hope on love. Also, she gets pregnant. After having the baby, she finds out that the father died in an accident the day after they had sex. Meanwhile, the younger sister doesn't feel she's pretty. In one scene she even puts on an exagerated '80s look. She becomes friends with a latino neighbor. He doesn't like that look, because he ""likes her the way she is"". They eventually start dating. 2) This one I'm not sure. I think it could be from the '90s but also the early noughties. Anyway, it takes place in the '60s or '70s. 2 14-year-olds are friends and also curious about sex. They undress and get close while standing up. He gets all horny but she's like ""Stop! That's my bellybottom"". Anyway, they ask for advice to his mom, and she's so liberal that she gives gives them advices. They have sex and she gets pregnant. However, she still doesn't want to date him. She dates some other guy. Oh, and there's a Native-American. I think he's dating the mom or something.
224447344	movie	extra	imdb	80s TV series or Anne of Green Gables? SOLVED: Avonlea. In the mid-80s, my family would gather round the TV to watch some bucolic TV show, and I could've sworn it was a TV series, like Pippi Longstocking, because we would keep gathering to watch it. But maybe it was Anne of Green Gables (1985) that was just shown repeatedly on tv? The one scene that I really remember was a boy who was poor, in period clothing, so dark wool clothing, maybe a chapeau of some type, running through the woods in snow, running away from I think a girl and an older woman. He comes across a shack, like a witch's hut, in the woods and I have a vague remembrance that characters avoided that shack. But for some reason he goes in it and finds out the old lady there is nice? Does anyone recall if this scene is from Anne of Green Gables or maybe another 80s TV series that was centered around a little girl? Thanks!
224967500	movie	extra	imdb	Strange Funny Cartoon. Okay this isn't a really old cartoon, probably around 10-15 years old, I don't know exactly the name of the show, but it was a series and very hilarious because they used the same kind of humor that South Park uses. About that. So I've always remembered this one scene from this cartoon and want to know what it is. Here's what I remember...there was this ant and it was just a regular ant, but then a few scenes later there was a giant mutant ant, and then this huge mutant sized magnifying glass pops out over its head because it's destroying some food supply or garden or something. That's really all I can remember of it that I can write in words. The rest is just images, really. Does anyone know of the cartoon that contains this scene? Because it was just kinda funny how the ant was gobbling away at something and this huge magnifying glass just suddenly pops out over him and his eyes just look up at it while he's eating. Kinda slapstick style.

He appears to be napping, but when a little girl pulls on his sleeve he opens one eye real big in a funny fashion. He calls the girl ""Rosebud."" Anyone know which movie that is? I went through the Jack Elam filmography here on IMDB but I couldn't figure out which title was the right one.
225053507	movie	extra	imdb	SOLVED-THX! (movie w/ 1 word title (girl's name), Mod mid-to-late 1960s). I once saw part of a European movie that was filmed in 1966 or later. I think it was following the life of a young female model, and I think she may have had two or three other models as roommates. The title was one word and it was the name of the main female character. It was filmed in color and is of the ""Mod"" style in fairly subtle way. I'm searching for it because the guy that was interested in the main girl drove a silver 1966 Bizzarrini GT 5300 Strada sports car throughout the movie. The movie I'm looking for isn't Darling; the title I need is a more common woman's name. (I've been searching every way I can think of but with no luck.) Thanks in advance.

225272409	movie	extra	imdb	Looking for movie title from the 90's SOLVED. It is about a girl who jumped off a high diving board, while sitting on a horse, in a competition or at a some kind of show. I think there was something about a jump going wrong, so she ended up being blind... perhaps it was actually the horse that went blind, I'm not sure. I might be wrong, but I think the horse was called Sky or something like that. I know that it's from the 90's, because it was available in Blockbuster around 93.

Stayed in a motel with my parents in the late 70's and watched a movie on TV about some people who traveled back in time to the dinosaur era, one of them may have been a Charles Bronson look-alike. Someone got eaten at the camp. Scared the heck out of me, but I was around seven or eight at the time and was afraid of any movie remotely scary. It may have even been a TV show.

It's set in a small town and there is a large fast food chain that opens a restaurant there and one of the main character's friends/family members goes to work there, and he's all excited about it. It's not one of the main plot points, just something that stuck with me. Thanks for any help.
225546408	movie	extra	imdb	funny courtroom scene: typist typing her abuse. Hi there, I have a film scene in my mind but can't place the film. I believe its a comedy film with this particular scene in a courtroom. Someone (lets assume it's the main character) is being cross examined and the typist is busy typing the conversation. The character then turns to the typist and says something like ""you're not going to type that, are you?"". She remains silent and, as is her duty, keeps typing. The character then says again something like ""are you serious?"" and she keeps typing while appearing threatened by the character. In fact, I think the person then starts handling the ticker tape and reading what she has been typing. Anyway, that's about all I can remember. I expect it is a film over 10 years. Can anyone help me out and jog my memory? Better still, link to a youtube clip?

I believe a veteran British actor played the director of the play, and everything that could have gone wrong did go wrong.

I remember catching the middle of a movie set in a possible apocalyptic desert (reminded me of Mad Max ala Thunderdome). There was a tribe of people who lived in the desert who depended on their supply of water (kept in a hole in the ground). The villain comes in riding in a vehicle that looked like the nose of an airliner. He has his cronies kill some of the people and steal the water cache. A hero named Ethan (I think) arrives and kills one of the cronies. The villain in an English or Australian accent asks him ""aren't you the one they say has magical powers?"" or something to that affect. I remember he kills the crony by swiping his walking stick against a hubcap or some type of round metal object, which projects at the guy slicing his neck. See.

225622565	movie	extra	imdb	Naughty but funny scene from a possible French film/show *SOLVED*. Basically the scene involves a blonde girl late teens/early 20s who is her bedroom, she opens her dresser drawer and sees that her vibrator is out of batteries, her mobile phone then starts to vibrate as someone is ringing her. Anyway she lays down on her bed and it's implied (there's no nudity or anything graphic) that she starts to masturbate using her mobile phone, her cat then bursts through her bedroom door and surprises her and it's implied the phone gets stuck inside her. Then it cuts to her having dinner with her parents and brother around the table and suddenly the phone starts to vibrate, everyone is wondering what the noise is and where it's coming from and she's trying to cross her legs to hide the noise and is making awkward faces. It's a funny scene (not pornographic) and I'd like to know what movie it's from, if anyone knows. I think it's French because I picked up a couple of French words in the dialogue, but then again it could be dubbed too. Thanks in advance to anyone who might recognize this scene.

225627924	movie	extra	imdb	(Half Solved) Looking for titles of two movies. The first movie I remember seeing on television in the early to mid 80's. It is somewhat along the lines of the original Death Race 2000. The racers hit pedestrians for ""points"" and they try to eliminate one another as well. One scene I clearly remember is at a sandy area and has one driver running over another and spinning out on his head. I have looked for this movie for years with no luck. It is not Death Race 2000. The second movie I remember watching on the old Elvira Mistress of the Dark show in the early 80's. It was a black and white movie about a little girl who was just pure evil and ""accidental"" deaths happened all around her. One scene I remember takes place in a barn where she causes the death of a little boy by having him fall on a pitchfork. I always for some reason thought this film was called The Godsend. But my searches for that only comes up with movie with De Niro and that's definetly not it. I know that is also not the black and white movie that's similar titled The Bad Seed. Please help if you can it will be greatly appreciated.

All I can remember is this old guy is helping investigate something and uncovers it, goes to visit this old Russian (?) spy who talks about his past. They talk for a bit and eventually the old American spy reveals what he knows, and they both openly know he (American) can't be allowed to live. He (American) comments he wasn't sure if he'd have the courage to kill himself if the time ever came, but he does. The Russian guy seems somewhat kind about it as they know it's inevitable. The American spy kills himself, I think cyanide. That's where he makes the comment about never knowing if he'd have the courage to do such a thing, being a spy and all. They met in the office of the old Russian spy. They discussed the old days, then the issue that the American was investigating. I remember it looking decent in quality, which is why I think it's relatively recent.

Not all that pleasant a subject, and rather difficult to watch, according to the story I read, but I would like to remember the name of the series anyway, so I can learn more about it. It ran either this past fall or in the fall of 2012. Does anyone know what it was called? HONK if you love Jesus... TXT if you want to meet Him...

225684599	movie	extra	imdb	movie name?. This one, I think, is very obscure. From what I recall it's a much older movie (and I don't mean 70s/80s!). All I remember is a girl who either gets taken away from her home or has a dream sequence where she's led out of her home to all of these crazy places. One of them is the place where kids wait to be born (they're not babies though - it looks like heaven and they might even have wings?) and she meets a boy and a girl who are very close or in love and then one of them is told that he/she is about to be born into the real world to a mother so they're not going to be together anymore. It's been like twenty years since I saw this so hopefully some of this is accurate enough to yield some results here. Thanks everyone!

225698380	movie	extra	imdb	Early 90s live-action Nickelodeon (?) kids TV show, 'secret lair' SOLVED. The host was an older, bearded man (Caucasian), sort of a Mr. Rogers rip-off kind of guy, who wanted to take you (the viewer) to his secret location. So the title sequence is him running through fields, over a fence, into a forest maybe, and eventually you end up in his secret ""lair"". He was carrying a backpack with him the whole time, I think. I don't recall the point of the show, and I think even as a kid, I watched it with a sort of perverse awe at how strange or bad it was. So I'm very curious to see it again. I think it was Nickelodeon, maybe PBS or something else. I watched a lot of shows around that time, including Heathcliff and Doug and Salute Your Shorts and Adventures of Pete and Pete, so I'm thinking it was around that time. Color TV show. All I remember is the title sequence.

225702883	movie	extra	imdb	Please help me recognize movie about FBI agent - SOLVED. First of all, my english isn't very good, but I hope I wiil be able to explain what I'm looking for. I'm looking for a movie that takes place in USA. There is some Chinesse crime organization and a FBI agent is sent to their base of operations. He is somehow presented to that crime organization as security advisor that they called for to help them hide from the FBI, so they let him in, after checking him for any tracking devices (that he have but they are unable to detect). There is a woman going with him that I think also a FBI agent. The secret base that he goes into is deeply underground, but his location is being tracked by FBI. Inside, he finds many flaws in their security and even shows them there is FBI car seen in their security cameras that they haven't noticed. Then he sees they are going to kill in a few minutes someone called, I think, Henry Chan. He is able to alert FBI about that, and the FBI understands this Henry Chan is a civilian, an American Chinesse, who have worked secretly for the FBI and as a construction manager of some projects in China, gave to USA some secret information that he shouldn't give. They locate them at construcion site in the USA, where he just finished his work day and wants to go home and his son is with him. They are able to call him very short time before the killers arrive and warn him, then they arrive there and I think they was able to save him. However in the base of operations, the criminals realize that someone has broadcasted a message to the FBI. Before they realize who did this, the disguised FBI agent says it's one of their people and kills him. I don't know what happened next, or what is the name of the movie. However it seems to be a quite new, or at least not very old movie. Does somebody know what the movie is ? Thank you in advance,
225703589	movie	extra	imdb	I'm trying to find a 50/60s movie whose title - SOLVEDx3!. I'm trying to find a movie whose title I don't seem to remember - which isn't a joy - especially for a 50/60s movie that I've not seen again since about then. I was especially impressed at the use of mobile radio-phones to connect Garner (in his Caddy) and his bosses (in their plane) using an operator - and Natalie Wood. I believe it starred Natalie Wood and James Garner, but the write-ups for ""Cash McCall"" and ""The Wheeler-Dealers"" don't make them sound like a fit for this movie. Garner plays an errand boy for three older millionaires who want to buy things a bit off-price. They get a notion to buy a painting - and since speed seems to be essential, Garner leaves his Caddy in the southwest and goes to New York by air. There he needs transport and a driver who knows the town, but cabs are a costly nuisance for his purposes, so he buys one (and it's driver) to be available anytime, then sells it back to the cabby at a financial advantage to both parties. He finds the Gallery - and Natalie Wood - and starts negotiating for the painting AND falling in love with her. His airborne angels figure this little quirk in the deal out and maneuver everything so everyone gets what they want. Can anybody be of help in this search? SOLVED! Thanks in advance, JB.

It's about a man who have super powers (I don't remember what was his powers, maybe extraordinary strength and speed). However he has one major vulnerability - he is very weak in the darkness, not only he doesn't have his powers ,but if he remains in the darkness he starts to feel very bad and ill. He have a small son, who have the same powers that he has, and also feels bad in the darkness. Then they both have to travel somewhere, the way is very long and the car goes a long way in the darkness, so they both feel bad... it's all that I remember. Can this movie be identified ?

225725200	movie	extra	imdb	80s movie: Blonde woman chained to wall [Solved: Subspecies]. I just stumbled across this image and I KNOW that I've seen the movie it's from. Unfortunately, Google's reverse image search was no help. I'm pretty sure that the movie was from the 80s, although I suppose it could be from the early 90s. I don't remember anything about the movie or the scene, I just know that I've seen this scene in a movie. I want to say that it's a horror movie, but it could have been an action movie. It would have been in English when I saw it, but I suppose it could have been dubbed. I don't think the blonde played a big part in the movie. I think she was a minor character who was grabbed by the bad guys and when you next see her, she's in this position. Or it's entirely possible that she was just a glorified extra, only appearing in this one scene. The picture includes some mild nudity, so NSFW; http://i61.tinypic.com/4tr615.jpg Note: Before anyone reports this as offensive or ""adult"" I'd like to point out that some of the photo galleries on this site contain just as much, if not more nudity as this one picture.

225731678	movie	extra	imdb	90's Scifi, I think Sean Connery was in it but his profile doesn't show. This was on cable in the 90's and depicted our near future. There was some young boy who got involved with something bad and his father was someone important. From what I recall, the father was Sean Connery and he was the commander of some militarized space station. I guess this evil corporation based in Las Vegas wanted him for one reason or another. Las Vegas was some metropolis at this point and really smoggy. The terrain was rugged and always windy. The boy hitched a ride through the desert on some truck that drove itself. I specifically remember they got in front of the truck and some computer voice ordered them to unblock the roadway. Sean Connery wasn't in this a lot. He only had maybe two or three parts. I remember he came down with the military in the end and shot the CEO of the evil corporation out of the sky with a rocket launcher. I wonder if this was some HBO flick they show every few years or late at night. It certainly is hard to find. Thanks in advance!

I'm trying to figure out what movie (or TV show) this is, so any help would be appreciated. I'm not sure about everything so I will bold whatever I am sure of in the scene. I'm thinking of a scene where a man works in an office full of women and he thinks he's about to get a promotion. Instead, the promotion goes to one of the women in the office. I think the man quits his job. (I think he breaks his boss' phone/bluetooth by smashing it into a wall....though this maybe from a different movie/show.) The next scene shows the man in an elevator with a bunch of women who are celebrating the promotion that one of them received. I believe the man is holding a box filled with things from his desk because he quit. It is very possible that I am mixing up two different movies/shows but I just thought I'd post to see if anyone can help me out at all. I asked someone and they believe it may be a scene from New Girl involving Schmidt but I am convinced this is from a movie because I feel I've seen this scene multiple times (and I rewatch movies more often than I rewatch most shows).

225860431	movie	extra	imdb	80s movie set in dangerous projects SOLVED. I am trying to figure out which movie this is.

Set either in Oakland or maybe the Bronx, a white guy finds himself in the projects after dark and ends up fighting for his life most of the night. Ring any bells?
225866420	movie	extra	imdb	Need a title please - SOLVED. Does anyone know the name of this old comedy movie...like a 1950-ish film. The story is about a cowboy who meets a woman...(maybe an actress)... marries her and takes her back to his ranch...where he has two daughters. His ranch is a fixer-upper... but there's a nice big ranch across the street. I think there might be an issue about water rights too. Also...while I'm asking... there's another old movie ...a drama that takes place in like the 1800s...(I suppose)...where a wealthy man marries a pretty but child-like woman. She is petite and has a foreign accent...maybe French. In time though he starts to resent her playful attitude and lack of responsibility. I think they have a small son. She is pushed out of her home...out of her family by her own sister. The petite wife finds a small place to rent...and then gets deathly ill. Do either one of these films sound familiar?

I think that the movie is from USA, made between 2001 and 2010. Movie is made as from an amateur camera of the protagonists; one gets the feeling that this is authentic and real, similar to blair witch project. First scenes are of young people (perhaps students) that arrive at some party (in some big American city, perhaps New York or LA). They have a good time until sudden blackout of electricity. There are scenes where buildings collapses. People storms out. There is a lot of running. One sees some giant monsters, but also there are some small monsters that can bite and infect people. Everytning is shot as from some amateur camera.

I remember there being two guys. One might've been a detective/cop. Obviously, there was also a girl. I remember her being troubled; brunette, too. I think it rained a lot during the movie, or was winter time? Uh...I think there was a murder, or maybe one of the guys was the killer, and maybe she started living with one of the guys. I think one of the guys had a bicycle? I would like to watch it again. I'm sorry that I can't recall more about it, and what I do recall may actually be incorrect.

225911502	movie	extra	imdb	[SOLVED] Movie about after life, angels/protectors, sickness. Ok, i'm going crazy here. Saw this movie some time ago and now I can't remember squat of the title. Goes something like this: Plot takes place in two places: reality and after life. Reality: A father has a young daughter in hospital and he tried to rush to her. She is protected by some people with weapons of some sort, one of them has a box that he uses for creating chain reactions, like it gives a little blow to a feather or can and it sets things in motion, resulting in big events. The daughter has a lady beside her most of the time. In the end her dad reaches her but don't remember if it was too late or saves her, he dies anyway, either suicide or gets killed. After life: we follow his daughter struggling to get back. She meets a woman, who is angel or protector, and they stumble upon a dark man with various things on him, he has a cloak and quite big nose. I think later in the movie he kills this woman and/or convinces her to give him the girl. There are other angels/protectors also. In the end i think the girl is kidnapped or brought to this dark place and our dark man saves her. He falls down and starts to cry. Plot twist: the father of the girl and this dark man are the same person. He becomes this dark man after he is dead in reality. I know only so far, hope some one knows which movie I'm talking about. All help is appreciated.

Hello wonderful movie buffs I am looking for a movie from most likely the 90s it may or may not have been good I may have been too drunk to remember anyway here is what I do remember. 1. The lead is a female vampire with I believe black hair.... 2. A police officer is trying to arrest her for what he believes are *murders* (she always make sure to kill her victims 100% so they never rise as Vampires so that might look like murder). 3. She tries to feed on a fat crime boss but is unable to do so since hes a heavy garlic eater and she ends up leaving him and not killing him... This creates a major problem since he rises as a vampire and makes his own little army... 4. She ends up teaming up with the cop to fight to *real* problem which is the crime boss and all his gang are now vampires and hell bent on taking over world... 5. She breaks the leg of one of the crime boss's guys and when he becomes a vampire he so happily smashes the pot off.... That's about all I remember. Should be enough to jog somebodies memory....

226028878	movie	extra	imdb	SOLVED. Help finding Bond film with obvious stunt double. Hi people, I'm sure there are loads of examples of dodgy looking stunt doubles in early Bond movies, but I'm looking for a specific clip and Googling it just brings up too much info about Bond stunts and I can't see the wood for the trees. Firstly, I think it is a Sean Connery Bond movie, so an early one. It is a scene where an Asian female (she is on Bond's side, I think, so a ""goodie"") climbs up a rope, and when she does it is obviously a stuntman in a bad wig. the scene is outside, and it is either a rope to a higher level of a building, or up the side of a ship. I think either way, it is at some docks or a port. Somewhere industrial, anyway. This might be a fight scene where Connery gets stuck in and she gets out of the way, but I don't remember the exact details. Any help you could give me would be brilliant. Thanks. What we are dealing with here is a complete lack of respect for the law.

226068280	movie	extra	imdb	Film Title Help Required. The film plot is based around a group of youths (teens) that form an underground society either by choice or through entrapment by the 'leaders' (also youths). I think (could be wrong) these couple of leaders turn out to be aliens that thrive on sexual activity to grow in power and that's why they formed this society hidden away. Also believe that some of the teens die and some try to escape. This film may well be a cult classic, and is set mainly around concrete with some graffiti, but don't think it features any famous actors as they're all young/teenagers. Approximate late 80's early 90's release, possibly a B-Movie. Any suggestions welcome! Thanks in advance.

226102652	movie	extra	imdb	SOLVED Horror anthology - small monster under bed attacks female lodger. Hey all. Looking to identify a horror anthology film I saw way back in the mid to late eighties. The one segment I remember is of a female lodger moving into a room at an older mans home, there's a small locked door in her room and at night when she sleeps a creature ventures out, hiding under her bed. Sequence ends with the creature killing her and the man coming in and cuddling it, like it's his daughter. Don't think it's a Creepshow movie. Any ideas? Give me a hedgehog and I'll show you.

226138860	movie	extra	imdb	Need help identifying this movie/show? (SOLVED). I'm looking for a movie/show that I remember watching years ago. I remember seeing one woman was attacked by someone who used some kind electrical device when the woman was outside at her car if I'm not mistaken. Then Later I remember two men were in a lake/river. One man was deep down at the bottom of the water while the other was still swimming at the top. And then suddenly someone popped right out of the water and I think it was that guy with the electric device and when I saw him, he looked as if he was a robot and he started fighting the man swimming at the top of the water.
226140879	movie	extra	imdb	I must know!!. Many years ago I saw maybe 15 minutes of a movie (at least I'm assuming it was a movie) but I never found out its name. Those 15 minutes periodically pop back into my mind and drive me crazy trying to figure out what it's from. Enough is enough! I must know! If anyone can help me identify what movie the following scene is from I would greatly appreciate it. I don't remember the main character's name so I will just call him Mike. Mike has died and is awaiting his Final Judgment. While waiting for their Judgment people lounge about in bright white robes in some bright white sushi restaurant. I remember Mike talking to one guy who said he died from a shot to the head. Mike's Judgment begins. It functions much like an Earth trial. A panel of judges oversee the case while a prosecutor presents Mike's sins and mistakes and a defense attorney defends him. Unfortunately Mike's original lawyer isn't available so he is given a new one. Mike fears this unfamiliar attorney will leave him at a disadvantage so he asks the trial be postponed. His request is denied and the trial begins. The prosecutor shows a video from Mike's life where he is eating lunch with a friend. This friend is starting up a new watch-making business and is offering Mike a chance to get in on the ground floor. Mike ultimately refuses but the business ended up taking off and produces a successful line of wristwatches. Even one of the judges is wearing one. The prosecutor points out that Mike missed out on a very big money-making opportunity. Mike's lawyer reacts like this is a damning piece of evidence. Mike fails to see the relevance at all. ""It's like you're saying the only point in life is to make money!"" he says. I had to stop watching at this point. Can anyone help me identify this? If I can't watch it I would at least like to read a plot summary somewhere. I really want to better understand what was happening here and how it ended. Help, please?

226144799	movie	extra	imdb	Need help with a 'Survival'-type film title.. I saw this years and years ago, and have only really just begun trying to figure out what it was called. I don't remember a great deal about it, but can remember the basic plot (I think) and prominent moments. The gist of it is about a boy/young teenager who gets stranded in the wilderness with his dog, a golden Labrador I believe (can't remember how). So the film then entails they're 'survival'...I'm pretty sure there was a moment with a grizzly bear, and how the dog fends it off. They eventually get rescued by a helicopter, or actually it's just the boy who gets picked up and the dog is tragically left behind! So the boy is naturally devastated about this, and the ending involves him aimlessly blowing his dog whistle in the vain hope of the dog coming back...and however in true Hollywood style it does indeed come back to him. Watched this whilst I was sick off school back in the day and am quite curious as to what it is called, so any help would be greatly appreciated. Cheers.

226168882	movie	extra	imdb	looking for a title of science-fiction movie with bad ending (solved). Hello Friend told me plot of a movie he watched when he was kid in public television in Poland around 2000 year (but the movie was foreign). Basically there were about 8 astronauts that were woken up from hibernate sleep after about 50 years. They were travelling to some planet in space. After they woken up, at first everything was normal but then commander of the crew committed suicide. Now, the person that was second in command took command. After some time he also committed suicide. Now, rest of the crew went to see the computer and communication and it turned out that they received message that earth was destroyed and they are probably only surviving people in universe (probably some nuclear war happened). Now, some things happened - most of the crew commited suicide apart from one man and one woman. Somehow they learned that it all was psychological NASA test to see if they can extend human kind. But after they got out of the bunker that they were in all along, it turned out that probably they are only people left in the universe. Some of the plot details may be wrong, because of the time that passed since 2000. I would be grateful for any suggestions on the title of this movie.

226184426	movie	extra	imdb	A movie of magic and dragons. One dragon at least. I saw part of this movie once and I'd like to find out the name. A dragon was terrorizing some medieval land. The land's King or Lord found a way to appease the dragon with periodic sacrifices of young maidens. The peasants are tired of losing their daughters to this dragon. The King is making no move to get rid of the dragon so they take the initiative. The peasants seek the aid of an old wizard for help. Just as the wizard is packing up to help, one of the King's men shows up and kills the wizard. Why, I don't know. Perhaps the King is afraid of rocking the boat and provoking the dragon? The amulet that is the source of the wizard's power passes to his Apprentice who instead offers his services. On their way to the dragon's cave the Apprentice discovers that the young man leading the group of peasants is actually a young woman. Her parents hid her gender so she would not be taken as a sacrifice. When they arrive at the cave the Apprentice causes a rockslide to seal the cave. The entire village celebrates and during the celebrations the young woman finally drops the ruse and dons a dress for the celebrations. However the King is not pleased. He has the Apprentice brought to his castle where he takes the amulet and locks him up. Does this sound familiar to anyone?

The crazy patients around him start mysteriously dying like hanging for example................ And the movie goes on, but by the end the doctor starts realizing that he is the one that is crazy and that he is the one that is killing his patients. Then the movie ends with a scene quite similar to the one at the beginning in which the doctor enters the hospital and a nurse or someone at the reception welcomes him, but at the end they bid him goodbye. Although it isn't much to go on, if anyone knows of this movie or movies similar your help would be much appreciated. You can just name similar movies if you want and I'll look them up.

226218957	movie	extra	imdb	Aftermath/Apocalyptic movie.. tough one.. FULLY SOLVED!!!. Ok this is from somewhere in the last 7 years i'd say, place it maybe around 2008 I saw it. This is very tough; I do not think it was a mainstream movie. The situation is something like people are in nomadic survival conditions of an urban area. Somewhere like Russia or France? Imagine something along the lines of Doomsday outside the city. There was a couple I think, they are the focus, the guy might have died. Or and there was a child that became the main character with the other girl. the scene I recall is some sort of compound, like a warehouse out in a rural area. they came upon it either because of a broadcast were able to make a broad cast within the compound. Then these riot squad anarchy nomads raid the place? its a pretty hectic engagement there someone might have died. The girl and the girl get out through a secret tunnel I think that led out into the wilderness? -------- I hate to cross movies if I might be doing so here. They linked up with some military people or some other survivors, and reach a water Dam where there is some sort of base. They got tracked there or had to leave there for some reason or another. I think if this is all the same movie, they wound up securing themselves at a prison or military base, with a gated area. A guy takes position in a tower. another pair take place in a bunker. The guy in the bunker runs out of ammo a shot gun i believe. so the other guy with him has to bail out on him. ------ another wild card scenario if this is all the same movie or maybe a third movie. they wind up in some small little town at a monastery or something, where they ran into more survivors and they had to leave there as well. I believe there was a focus point of the main guy and him having a child maybe ? Or maybe there was a satellite. These are either all one and the same movie or two different movies. Id appreciate help with either of them if they are separate. It is very poor description I feel like, the scenery is very distinct to me. Also if you watch these kind of movies you might be able to pin point it. I think its something most like Doomsday apocalypse world. EDIT: if you have seen Open grave when they drive down the road in the car to that warehouse.. the scenes when they are in the warehouse remind me of the compound of my first description.

226230723	movie	extra	imdb	Man with roadkill night job traces parrot's previous owners? SOLVED!. I was just talking to someone whose (rescue) parrot just died of old age and he told me he had once met someone who, by sheer coincidence, had owned the same bird. His story stirred a dormant movie memory, which is extremely fuzzy. In this movie, the main character--who is a well-known actor in an unusual role--is a loner who has a job driving around at night (in Houston?) and cleaning up traffic accidents or road kill. He eats at a 24-hour diner and lives in a small trailer. He meets a quirky girl and it's touch/go whether they'll be able to sustain a relationship. In the background, I think the man is trying to track down people who had owned his parrot. The romance fails but he does find the bird owner's widow and it's all very depressing. In the end, he regains consciousness from an injury to find that the quirky girl has hooked up his little trailer and is hauling him off to happier times. I'm sure someone knows the name of this movie and I'd love to be able to tell my sad parrot owner friend. Thanks in advance, C.

226246054	movie	extra	imdb	[SOLVED] Unknown Episode : Lucky guy wins lottery. Ok, so the title isn't to specific i know. A few years ago i watched what i think it was an episode from a TV Series (maybe X Files ??..) The plot begins with a guy who participates a poker game and he keeps winning hand after hand. The surroundings of the poker game aren't to legit and the other players seemed to be some kind of gangsters. After the game the lucky guy leaves and on his way home (i think) those mobsters try to kill him pushing him off a tall building,he lands in a bin and goes home. Following the story we find that anytime when the guy has luck something bad to someone happens around him. In a scene the guy goes to a store and buys a lottery ticket, the store clerk ask him why he is not buying a more expensive ticket with a more substantial win but he tells him that he don't need that amount of money (like he was sure that the ticket wich bought it's gonna be winner). The store clerk becomes interested in his story, the guy briefly explains it and he chooses another ticket for the store clerk or another customer, i don't remember exactly. The ticket is winner and the customer/store clerk is enthusiast but dies as he leaves the store. In the end i think that the guy was trying to earn some money for a sick kid but i'm not sure.

226255166	movie	extra	imdb	SOLVED.Movie title help: therapist/patient relationship in the old days!. I've been searching all over for this film, but I can't seem to find it. What I can recall from it is this: I'm pretty sure that it was located in England, and it was quite a little back in time. A woman gets sent to a mental institution, and they don't quite know what's wrong with her. She starts to get special treatment from our other main character, the doctor. They get along really well and I don't remember how fast, but they end up getting intimate. The doctor uses new techniques on her and talks it over with this other old guy. She ends up getting released from the institution, I think, and she moves to the city. And some time passes, and the doctor seeks her out, I think. And they end up having sex, and I'm not sure about this, but I sort of think that she has a partner at that time? From here on I only sort of remember the ending, which is that they meet up? By the sea, I think. And she turns out to be pregnant, and it's not his, so they part ways? If you have any idea about the title, it'd be much appreciated.

In my high School English class (I'm going to say 4-7 years ago) we watched a film that was based on a short story that we were reading and the film is about this girl who lived on a farm house (I think she was a teenager or 20-something, basically under 21 and over 13 but she was pretty tall for a teenager and she had blond or light hair). Then, when her parent(s) left and she was by her self this man drives up to her house who looks like a greaser or something with along with this big (bald?) guy in the driver's seat, who I think had on sunglasses and never spoke a word. The greaser guy gets out and says to her promiscuous things and shows her a number on his car (69?) that had a sexual meaning and tell her to get in to show her a good time or something (she was obviously a virgin). He then takes her to this grass field and, although it shows nothing, you can obviously tell what he was doing with her there (He didn't rape her as it was consensual, I think). That's all I remember. I don't know if the movie shares the same title as the short story, though. additionally, it looked like a Strait-To-video movie or a TV-Only movie with an extremely low budget and it looked like it was made in the 90s. In fact, I think it was a short film. Any thoughts? ""They're all your hats, Mr. Angier.""

226293025	movie	extra	imdb	British 50s/60s Thriller. I'm trying to remember the name of a thriller I vaguely remember from many years ago. The story was set in Europe and centred around a plot to unhinge a young girl. I think her father had been murdered but the body was hidden. She eventually comes across the body when she falls in the swimming pool. I think she may have been in a wheelchair. Also her chauffeur was part of the plot. It has a very similar feel to ""Chase a Crooked Shadow"".
226296190	movie	extra	imdb	What is this movie? (Solved: Palmetto). (Look below for edit) I watched a movie in the late 90's or early 00's that I can't seem to find anywhere. I can't remember the lead actor so I am having a hard time finding the title. This is what I can remember about the plot. So what I remember is that the main character is a writer (I think a crime fiction writer). He has writers block and is spending time in a lake house or cabin. He is mostly just smoking cigarettes and wasting time. At some point a dead body comes into the story and for some reason he feels obligated to dispose of it. It is in his trunk. The car is like an old buick or something the type of car that doesn’t have a button to pop the trunk. So he is going out to the country to dispose of the body. At that point either a police officer pulls him over for something like a break light out, or he gets a flat and a officer stops to help him. He knows the officer. The officer is real friendly. Maybe he has a flat I don’t remember but at some point the officer asks him to pop the trunk. He can’t cause there is a dead body inside. So he breaks the key off in the trunk lock and says oops. or something like that. That whole scene it is raining hard and dark if I remember correctly. Ok so later when the body is found the police call him in as an expert on crime scenes (I think because he is a crime fiction writer) So he is wondering around the scene with the police and he sees one of his cigarette butts he dropped when he was hiding the body. He tries to hide the butt but the cop finds it and says isn’t that your brand with a laugh. I remember the setting was ""the present"" so it would have been whatever year the movie came out. Could be late 80's to early 00's. Not sure. That's all I have. Any suggestions what movie this might be? EDIT: (Solved) I checked out those links Star-Core posted. That is definitely the movie I remember. I misremembered the part about the main character being a writer and that's what threw me off. I'm guessing that when I watched that movie I caught it on cable and was switching back and forth between another movie. That's the only thing that would explain why I was so off about the main character's back story. That and its been over 10 year since I've seen it. Oh well. Thank you all for helping me figure it out. Thanks to Star-Core for solving this for me.
226297979	movie	extra	imdb	Horror/thriller/suspe nse movie about girl finding wax arm in bowl. I am looking for the name of a movie I saw as a child. It was on tv. There is one scene that keeps running through my head. There is a girl about 12 in pajamas with long hair and bangs. Her hair is pulled back with a barrette. The bottom of her hair is hanging down. She has a very high pitched voice. I believe the movie is horror or thriller. The name Lucy comes to mind. Not sure if that is the characters name or the actresses real name. In the scene I remember I recall a big bowl of water with an arm in it. The girl is screaming. Come to find out the arm is made of wax. I have the impression the girl saw something she shouldn't have and some one is trying to drive her crazy. I saw this movie in the late sixties possibly the early seventies. I have tried searching everywhere to find the name of this movie. I have used horror, thriller and suspense for movie type plus I have used the year range from 1940 to 1970. I think the movie was made in black and white but can't be sure. This is driving me crazy. I had another movie that was doing the same thing but I found out it was ""picture mommy dead"". The reason I found it was because of the worm song. I would appreciate any help. I'm to young to go crazy! Lol

226318962	movie	extra	imdb	HELP with movie title... ((SOLVED)) thank you. ok so what I remember goes like this.. the movie was about a girl who kills another girl & for most of the movie she keeps said girl in her bathtub. The girls i think knew each other from babysitting. Most of the movie revolved around the parents of the missing girl, the cops and the girl who did the killing & her dad.Also the girl who got killed had a boyfriend the parents didn't know about & if i remember correctly the bus she took to the 'killer' girls house played a part. I remember the 'killer' girl had some sort of mental problems & her dad was always phoning her. I think the 'killer' girl may have been Australian. most of the movie took place with cops/parents searching or at 'killer' girls house with her on the phone.. or freaking out or looking over the dead body in the bathtub..... sound familiar? thanks in advance

I saw it in the late 80's or early 90's. I think maybe there is a scene at an airport early on in the movie. Some guy finds some personal organizer type book that somebody lost/left behind. In it is a key to somebody's house and maybe information about this person like maybe his address. I think the guy who found the book maybe goes to his house of the guy who owns the book and stays there without the guy knowing it. I think the guy who owns the house is rich or something. The guy who finds the book may also have a male friend who is also in this film. Remember the scene from Home Alone where Macaulay Culkin kinda travels from an upstairs room in his house to the treehouse in the yard by traveling on a rope by using a clothes hanger? Something like this happens in the film but instead of using a clothes hanger I think the guy used that personal organizer book. Anybody know please? Thanks! :-)

She gets into trouble and has to go to detention or something, or maybe that didn't even happen. No, it didn't. It was her study hall class and the seating was alphabetical. The boy she sat near was ""awful"" to her and the line in the movie goes something like, ""his name was ____ (pretty sure it starts with an H) and i had to pleasure (????) of being close to him alphabetically"". basically she hates him but eventually falls for him and he has a really tough home life and an abusive father. there's a scene in the movie where he takes a bunch of tabs of acid in class and has a seizure on the floor. another scene is on the beach, where he's telling the girl that he's going to fake his own death. i think the movie ends where the girl is now pregnant years and years after high school and she sees the boy again at a supermarket and he like belongs to a religious society or something. THIS HAS BEEN KILLING ME FOR WEEKS NOW. NO AMOUNT OF GOOGLING IS HELPING ME. PLEASE SOMEONE. also, a big part of the movie was the creative writing class they were both in and they both read poems out loud in class that were very clearly directed at each other.

226401409	movie	extra	imdb	70:s Vampire Horror Movie Question SOLVED!!. Funny thing is I remember watching this movie as a kid but the name escapes me, and I remember some of the plot but most of the exact details I'm fuzzy about but I can basically describe the outline of the plot to give you the basic drift of what it is I'm looking for. What I think I remember clearly is that the movie had to do with a vampire couple, man & wife and they meet this man who's a werewolf. They either know who he is or find out somehow and basically they wind up telling him that they're going to help him out and do their best to cure him. In the end they wind up screwing him over, they got him chained to a wall and the man vampire reads from this book and it's actually a exorcism in reverse where he's cursing the man's soul & saying all sorts of ungodly things to the poor guy. The man changes into a werewolf, breaks free of his chains and catches up to the male vampire and kills him. Something like that. Just taking a chance someone may recognize this from what I have described. Thanks in advance!

226426179	movie	extra	imdb	Need title for an old movie, please... SOLVED. I don't remember much about this film. I have no idea who starred in it...but I don't recall a 'huge' star. I'm guessing that it was a 1950s film...although who knows maybe it was from the 40s or 60s. The drama starts with a man going to a house...(in the daytime)... maybe an English country home... and driving up the kinda long driveway. The house seems familiar to him. There's a few other people at the house...men and women. People with british-like accents...or maybe it's just proper 'new england' accents. He says that it feels like he's been there before. He may be an architect. I think he says...or at least in his head...that someone will die. Maybe he's talking about himself. I think one of the people in the house is a doctor/psychiatrist. I think a young lady arrives after he does... and I think she gets dizzy, sick feeling... or maybe that was him too. The film takes place mostly in the front room of the house. Not much action... mostly just talking. Unfortunately that's all I really recall now. I don't know WHY anyone would die...they all seemed civil... and I don't even remember the end...so I don't know if someone did die or not. Does this movie sound familiar to anyone? Thanx :)

I can not guarantee it was from the 80's/90's, but I have a strong hunch it was. Hope somebody can help me! =)

Anyway her mother was like a real stickler for chores and in one scene she was mumbling something like, ""hmm chores are all done"" The girl did get to go to the high school but it was quite an experience for her. She needed more materials, other kids made comments behind her back about her clothes, the work load and deadlines were intense. She met this other boy there who was also poor. He lived in a cave. He took her to his cave and the girl was saying to him that he can't live like this, it is not good and he should go to the orphanage. The boy said he had been doing fine for years, and then when the girl tried approaching him he armed himself with a big heavy stick, telling her to stay back. That's all I can remember. It might have been set in the 1930s because my grandma always talks about the depression and her school years.

226499479	movie	extra	imdb	Nazi comedy/drama. This is a film I saw on TV when I was a boy in the 70's, so it was probably a 60's cinema release. It was a very low-key comedy about an occupied village in WW2 where the Germans were searching for the annual wine/champagne harvest. The villagers hid it in an old cellar and bricked it up. It was a 'them vs us' comedy, with villagers in on things nodding to each other in the street and the Germans tearing their hair out trying to find the wine. In my head it's Telly Savalis or Anthony Quinn as the Mayor of the village but I can't find it under either of their film listings. My parents remember it so I KNOW I didn't dream it.

226502967	movie	extra	imdb	SOLVED: TV movie about plane hijackers. Here's one, I saw it on Channel 5 (UK) maybe ten years ago (or more?), so it would've been made at some point before 2004 (seems 1990s-ish thinking about it). What I remember is the various character introductions (as usual), and then a woman (who is a hijacker) goes into the toilet on the plane and assembles a white gun from various bits of plastic she has in her bag. The only other part I remember is the female protagonist has to go in the toilets for some reason, and the flight crew think she's joining the ""mile high club"", so afterwards they're collecting rubbish and they approach her and say ""Trash?"" in a nasty, sarcastic manner. Not a lot to go on there, sorry!
226509209	movie	extra	imdb	*SOLVED* Help with three different lake mystery movies. Ok, so I remember seeing two different movies in the late 90's - early 2000's that I need some help with. -I believe they were all tv movies (possible lifetime - I used to watch a lot of lifetime with my grandmother) -They all had to do with a lake, #1 more than #2 & #3 though. I was thinking of the one and it triggered my memory of the others lol #1 SOLVED - THE LAKE It's about a young woman who moves into a new town (or maybe she's moving back from college or something because I vaguely remember her having family in the town). There's something strange going on with the lake in the town and people start acting different. The woman starts investigating and I think something winds up happening to her. Like whoever is messing with the lake/people in town kidnap her or something. #2 SOLVED - THE SECRET This one is about a girl who is drown in a lake (by her boyfriend I think). I believe she is pregnant, and he kills her. It has something to do with him trying to hide that he was with her and got her pregnant. She might have been his lady on the side and he had another girlfriend or was married (though from what I remember they were in high school, so he probably wasn't married). A young woman (I think they go to school together, it was probably the girl's friend) starts to investigate the death of the pregnant girl. #3 SOLVED - WHAT LIES BENEATH This one is about a woman who starts experiencing weird things in her house. She starts seeing things and realizes she's being haunted by the ghost of a girl. She starts looking into it and she finds out her husband murdered the girl in the lake outside of their house. I think her husband tries to kill her after she finds out too. Sorry for all the shoddy details!

226530024	movie	extra	imdb	Vampire movie name from the '70's, I think. *SOLVED*. I'm not sure if this is the opening scene of this movie or not but there is a couple in their teens or early 20's parked at a cemetery. They're making out in the backseat of the car when suddenly the back door on the boy's side is ripped off. He's pulled out of the car and slammed on top of a tombstone, breaking his back. The vampire chows down on him while the girl is in the backseat screaming. After he's done with his midnight snack he returns to the car and drags the girl out. He then takes off with her across the cemetery and back to his open grave and coffin. The next thing I remember is a scene from years in the future. She's talking to her son and we find out that her son is the son of this vampire who killed her boyfriend. I believe the only time she saw the vampire was the night of the attack. I also think the scene where she was talking to her grown son she was telling him the circumstances of her pregnancy and who his father is. It's been years since I've seen this movie but I'm pretty sure it's from the 70's. Maybe late 60's, but I lean more towards early 70's. If anyone can put a name to this movie I will be forever thankful! The arrogance of man is thinking nature is in our control and not the other way around.

226577657	movie	extra	imdb	2 old horror movies - What is the titles?. Hi everyone! Im desperately seeking 2 old movies what I saw in my childhood. The 1st one is an alien horror movie, a big headed alien killed people in the forest and had some parasites under his ""jacket"" pentagon or hexagon form. Shooted them and they killed people with claws. Was very scary at that time. Soem years ago I almost found it but lost the title. There are ""invader"" or ""visitor"" in it or something like that. The 2nd one is older I think. There are some giant crabs and hunted people in an island. People (men and women both) looked like ""cavemen"" I mean their clothes was very primitive. Dressed like the Flintstones... You know. The only thing what I clearly remember that a women stucked in a quicksand and sunk down while the others tried to help her. They tried to drag her back but the ground swalloved her. I found a title Attack of the Giant crab but it takes places in modern days and they flee among buildings so... Thank you to everyone who help me :)
226578175	movie	extra	imdb	Can't think of film from '89-'90 - BUGGING ME!!. Ok, so I remember seeing this film IN the theater. It was either in late'89 - early-mid '90, and I'm almost 100% sure of that, because I went with several of new friends that I had recently met on my dorm room floor, freshman year of college. It was about gay men or, perhaps more specifically, the AIDs crisis. I could've sworn Bruce Dern was in it, but when I looked at his IMDb profile, I didn't recognize any of the titles from those few years. So I'm thinking the actor was another ""Bruce"" (I don't know why, but the name just stuck with me, over the years!!) - and in the late 80s/early 90s, this particular ""Bruce,"" if I'm recalling him correctly, was probably in his 40s/50s, with thick, silver hair. Does ANYONE have ANY ideas as to what movie this might have been?!? Thanks!!!

Also, episodes on Heather Locklear and Charlie Sheen, though available, are from 2004 and 2010 respectively, but I seem to remember seeing them much earlier, in the late 90s to maybe 2000 at the most. The Brendan Fraser episode was in the 90s too I think before the first 'Mummy' movie even. Is there another show similar to E!THS, which I'm getting mixed up with?

226654280	movie	extra	imdb	TV episode either from Hitchcock or Playhouse (solved by Mrs. Swanson). ....or early '60s.Convict shares cell with a bank robber. The latter brags that he has a stash of stolen cash hidden somewhere and he was going to get it when he gets out and re-unite with his woman. He also brags about his woman who he says is so beautiful and in the summer she gets her legs all tan and nice. I think the bank robber dies. Anyway, the other guy gets out and locates the woman of the bank robber's dreams. She is a blond and buxom but somewhat fading beauty (may have been portrayed by Shelley Winters). The ex-convict courts the woman and he thought he succeeded. The money was hidden in the basement of her house and the ex-convict finds it. Somehow the woman tricks or overpowers the man and he ends up bound in the basement of the isolated house. Woman got the money and the dialogue between her and the ex-convict was memorable: Man: You know when I was in the slammer with your husband/man, he would talk about you endlessly saying how beautiful you are and how you would get your legs nicely tan in summer.But hey!....(giving a sardonic smile and laugh). Woman: (With pouty expression) So you were disappointed, huh? Man: (face contorted with loathing) Disappointed?! I was disgusted!!! Woman (as she ascends the stairs leaving the man to die of starvation): Oh well, I think I'll go somewhere like Switzerland where they have those spas and doctors to fix my face and figure. I am quoting from the memory of a child which I was at the time I saw it and I may be making some of it up but I think I got the ideas conveyed down pat. The man may have been portrayed by John Cassavetes.
226657472	movie	extra	imdb	*SOLVED*Looking for a WW2 comedy. Hi there! A few years ago I already posted here about this film, but sadly nobody found the solution, so I'm here, trying again. The film is most probably a comedic take on WW2. It was in color, and the time period can be anywhere from 1970-2000, I really don't know... if I had to narrow it down, my guess would be maybe 85-95. There is only once scene I remember, which is, if I'm correct, somewhere towards the end of the film: A man gets dressed up as Hitler to escape (possibly Europe). If my memory is good, he steals a plane and successfully escapes, but either the plane crashes or malfunctions which forces him to land. He survives, and finds a motel or some kind of bar nearby. He opens the front door with his Hitler moustache on, making everybody in the bar suprised and frightened. At that moment he loudly asks the people ""Am I in America?"" or ""Is this America?"". Two smaller notes: - The plane might have crashed into the bar as well, and not next to it. - I've seen this dubbed, but I don't think the line can be much different in the original version. It's most probably an English speaking film, but could be French as well. I hope that the whole thing's not too vague, and that someone can indentify the movie in question. Thanks in advance!

These are all the relevant details /clues I can remember.... - I have seen this movie in last few years but likely made late 90's ??/ 2000's - I remember only a guy & girl - a pair of previous strangers to one another as the only cast-members, he picks her up at night in his car / she turns up at his apartment ( I can't quite remember how she arrives at his place, but I THINK it's former -iE his car pickup - as I think too that I remember this symmetrically matching the ending where he drops her off in his car the next morning... - the action takes place entirely over one evening at his loft warehouse apartment - I THINK the movie has a one word title from memory- tho I can't remember if this title was in English or German ( I saw an English subtitled version) - Most of the film's action takes place in the guy's warehouse/industrial loft-style apartment space- lots of black walls/ minimalism decor I remember - BDSM / S & M powerplay happens between the pair. - In the second half of the movie she fakes her death to freak him out after she has been in the bathroom which he believes/re-constructs /sees on CCTV -the pair are young-ish actors - certainly both under 40, I can't remember much else- just that the really dynamic powerplay tension between the two is memorable & sexy ( that's why I want to find it again-> to see if it's as strong & vital as I remember) - Finally, I vaguely remember them parting company at the end of the film on an isolated road when he drops her off the next morning.
226730380	movie	extra	imdb	Protesting Porn Star? [SOLVED]. Okay, weird question, but I've been trying to think of what movie this is for months now and I can't do it. All I can remember is there's a scene where some guys are driving by and there's a big group of protesters with picket signs protesting, and one of them is a well known porn star. I think she may even bang on the vehicle when it drives by. I don't know who the porn star is, but I think she may have been petite sized. Ha ha! I know. Freaky weird question. But somebody's got to know the answer, right? Help please!
226747331	movie	extra	imdb	[SOLVED] Name of the movie from 80s (90s?). Hello. Saw this one between 1988 and 1992 (probably 1989-1991). It is related to computers, I guess it was shot in late 80s. It is about two men, they work as computer coders or videogame crackers or something similar. One of those men is funny kind of a guy, he likes joking, enjoying life, another guy is a melancholic kind of a person. The funny one has a girlfriend. This funny guy sometimes puts the gorilla or king-kong mask on his face to scare the other guy. I think they live in the same flat but I am not sure about this. It is probably a TV movie, maybe not a Hollywood production. It is possible it is a movie from Switzerland, Germany or another country that belonged to the western part of the world in the 80s. I have no idea about the language. Thanks for any kind of help.

226773063	movie	extra	imdb	[SOLVED]Searching for a movie name from late 80s with computers/games. I am searchng for a movie name, unfortunatelly have no more info available, saw it only once almost 25 years ago. I saw it between 1988 and 1992 (probably 1989-1991). I doubt it was shot before 1985 because the computer/games facts were pretty up to date when I saw it (I was at that time interested in computers a lot and knew something about them) so I guess this movie is from 1986-1991(1992). It is about one man or two men, they work like computer coders, crackers, games creators or something like that. One of the men uses small notepad for taking notes when coding/hacking/cracking/programming. The notepad maybe plays some role in the movie but can't guarantee it. Maybe computers and games are not what the movie is all about but it is related to computers or gaming in some way. Maybe its a TV movie, not a movie for cinemas. It may have couple of episodes, two or three, probably not more, it is not a regular TV show. I checked many lists with movies about video games and computers, it's not on any. The movie is definitely not a mainstream one. Then I am looking for a movies in which the game Rampage is played. It is this game: http://johnlinkmovies.files.wordpress.com/2012/02/rampage_nes_screenshot3.jpg If you have any ideas, please share them. Thanks for reading and any kind of help.

226783708	movie	extra	imdb	Very old B/W insurance fraud film SOLVED. Film I saw in the 80s on the ""late show"". Probably made in the 50s, b/w, cast I didn't recognize. Story involves a man using his daughter for insurance fraud after she slightly hurts her leg. She's made to fake serious injury, but ultimately uses the scheme to her own advantage and stops going to school and doing chores. It becomes a very serious mental handicap, because she convinces herself that she is truly crippled and in serious pain. This movie had some light comedic trappings in the beginning, but is otherwise a pretty serious and straightforward drama. Any ideas? Butt out of this or I’ll strip the hide off your cherry picker!

The one I remember to ask the most. This is a film. Wha is the title. Was released in between 2000 and 2012. Probably an Indie or Arthouse drama. About problem kids in school. Most of them are non - whites. This new teacher comes to rescue them with upmost enthusiasms. They will eventually do better in life and school obviously. I think there was a death scene. Not sure though. The scene that I remember the most is when the teacher teaches about racism throughout human history or something like that and the teacher says that one of the most racist things people say is that Jews have humongeous noses which is a stereotype. The film is mediocre. BUT. Decent. Do you guys know the title of this film? THANK YOU FOR YOUR TIME AND HAVE A NICE DAY ;-)

226846136	movie	extra	imdb	SOLVED - Documentary that played in theaters in the 1960s - 1970s. I'm trying to find out the title of a movie from the late 1960s or early 1970s. It was a documentary with two sides: a poor community (possibly Appalachian) and some sort of big industry that was keeping the residents poor. At some point during the filming one of the key players was murdered and the subject of the documentary sort of shifted to tell that story. It was strongly suggested that someone from the other side was responsible and was going to get away with it. I don't know if the victim was from the poor community or the big industry. I never saw this film. I just heard about it. I always thought is was Medium Cool (1969), but I just saw that yesterday. It was not the film I thought it was. The movie I am trying to remember was definitely a documentary about real people, and not a movie with fictional characters. ""Biting's excellent. It's like kissing, only there's a winner.""

226857824	movie	extra	imdb	Looking for a movie title. I only saw this movie once and it was over 30 years ago so I remember very little about it. It was a James Bond inspired film but it was NOT from the Flint or Matt Helm series'. Probably made in the late 60's or 70's. I thought that the star was Glenn Ford but I can't be sure about that. Anyway it is about some sort of Superspy who may have also been a former boxer. The main thing that I remember is that the bad guy had a very diverse group of henchmen. They included a huge Eskimo, an Arab, a guy with a hook for a hand, and a big bald guy with near super human strength. I also remember that the hero was friends with a group of pro bodybuilders and there was a big fight scene where the bodybuilders took on the evil henchmen. Does this ring any bells for anyone?

226874056	movie	extra	imdb	Help me find these two TV shows!. When I was young growing up I would watch ABC Kids (in Australia). There were two shows that were on that no one I know can seem to recall, or if they do it is vague and they don't know their names. I was wondering if anyone could help me find them. Unsolved: The first was fairy-tales, a different one every week. But they weren't cartoony and childish, they told the original dark fairy-tales and the animation style was dark and gritty, almost sketch like. I can remember one about someone who wore a Wolf Skin over them. And (I'm unsure if I actually remember these) Red Riding Hood and the Pied Piper. SOLVED: 'Ted Sieger's Wildlife' The other one was very cartoony and might have been foreign as it had animal but they didn't speak just made sounds. Everything was alive in it, the sun, the stars, the moon even trees. And it started with the animals marching in a parade before colliding into each other than sitting down to watch something on a projector that would then be the episode. Any help would be appreciated! It's frustrating the hell out of me. Thanks! http://randomlydrawnstickfigurecomics.wordpress.com/
226874496	movie	extra	imdb	Two scenes: TV shows, specials, movies...I'm not sure.. 1. Some kind of suspense/crime solving show. As I remember, although my memory may be faulty, each episode had some kind of special effect, and the tag scene showed how the effect was done. Like there was a lightning storm in one episode, and the tag scene showed how a rain machine and a Lightning StrikesTM work. In another, characters were playing billiards, and the tag showed how the billiard table was rigged so shots would go in or not as necessary. In this case, it's possible that there was no such show. It could be that I saw a TV special devoted to explaining SFX, and I conflated that with some show my parents watched; Mission Impossible or something. But it could be a show that had a very short run. It was in the early 1970s that I saw whatever I saw. 2. A space-themed show. Saw it in 1978 or 1979. Absolutely not Star Trek. At the end of the show (movie?) a woman was going to go on a lone mission. She overhears two other characters fretting about the possibility that she might not return and might not survive. Her response: ""If I die in space, it would be fitting. I was born there."" Maybe Lost in Space in a later season. Maybe Space: 1999; maybe a (TV?) movie. But I'm sure I saw that scene, whatever it was in.
226877103	movie	extra	imdb	SOLVED 80s BBC children's treasure hunt (NOT Ch 4) with 'Altar Egg-o'. There was a children's programme on the BBC in the early 1980s that involved working out the location of treasure on a map grid. The prize at the end of one series was a piggy bank full of halfpenny coins. It was dropped on the floor and then 'reassembled' by winding the film backwards. The following year the presenter had a miniature version of himself as a sidekick by the name of 'Altar Egg-o', as the location of the treasure turned out to be on the altar of a church and was a set of porcelain eggs (I may not be right about the eggs being the actual prize). In the first year, or one of the early years of the series, it was possible for children to get a certificate showing they had solved the puzzle if they sent in the correct answer before the last programme was broadcast. I don't think that the programme was called 'Treasure Hunt', but I cannot be all that certain. Does anyone know what it was called?

226899513	movie	extra	imdb	Title Help -- Asian Thriller on Netflix. I need help figuring out the name of a movie I watched awhile ago on Netflix. It was Asian and could be categorized as a thriller. A man takes a job from a sketchy dude in order to earn money to find his missing wife. Everyone thinks his wife left him but he believes she just needs money to come back to the country. The job is to murder some important man. He travels to when this man lives, staying at a halfway house (for lack of a better term) on the way. During this stay he talks with men that work with the sketchy dude. One of them drops or throws a lighter. The camera has a close-up of this lighter on the floor and it becomes a small key to the plot later. The apartment in which the man-to-be-murdered (MTBM) lives is in a building that is closed up every night by a couple of professional men. The MTBM lives on the top floor which is not accessible to anyone. I don't remember much else... I think he ends up killing the MTBM on the stairwell... the wife turns out to be living with some guy who kills her....... Sound familiar to anyone? Thanks in advance!
226900573	movie	extra	imdb	Name of movie about an orphan looking for his mother (Solved). I first watched the movie around 15 years ago in cinema so it must have been produced in late 90's. I have also seen that several years later on TV. It was the channel of the greek parliament if that helps. It is a non-English movie possibly from Iran or another West-Asian country. The original language was also non-English. About the plot: The boy was dreaming of his mother which looked like one of the social workers working in his orphanage. At some point he managed to escape from it and follow her to her house. She was trying to make him go back but he kept coming back. Again at some point I remember that she tried to adopt him, then she helped him look for relatives. I remember for sure that the ending was sad. I can give more details about parts of the movie but I think it won't help a lot.
226913741	movie	extra	imdb	Need help reminding 2 films, please!. Hey everyone, 1. I have seen this movie when i was a kid in mid 90s (movie could also be from mid-late 80s). I know many details about it including the name of the movie but it was translated in my native language so i can't really find the exact translation of it in english. The movie is about an experiment somewhere inside a laboratory or some kind of quarantine place. It involves mostly women if i remember correctly. I believe they have some kind of timer inscriptioned (like a tattoo) somewhere in their skin and when it runs out there's this kind of ""mutant human"" (also part of the experiment i think) that comes after them and kills them one by one. I also believe that at the end of the movie one of the survivors (the last one?) finds out that one of the doctors who made the experiment on them was her husband or something like that. EDIT I'm pretty sure the entire movie happens inside this laboratory where these women are chased around by this mutant. EDIT 2 This is a reply from someone on reddit, might help in the search of the movie. ""I've seen this movie, and unless there is a more recent remake, it's much newer than the 80s or 90s. I watched it on Netflix within the last 2 years or so, and it was definitely from the mid-late 2000s. I remember all of the details that you described but I can't, for the life of me, remember the name of the movie or any actors. It was definitely more of a B-movie. I've been searching for a while with no results. I vaguely remember the title being something like ""Project 23"" or something along those lines"" 2. (SOLVED) This movie also seen in the 90s is about a kid and his dog, they get lost (cant remember how) but at some point an helicopter finds them but it is impossible for the helicopter to land so they send someone down a rope to pick the kid and the dog up but somewhere in mid air the dog falls down and they leave without him. I also remember that at the end of the movie the kid blows into something and out of nowhere the dog comes running. Sorry for my english and i hope my details help enough!

I can't remember much more about the plot; the thing that I remember most is a scene, early in the film, that takes place when the student was a boy, early in the 20th century, in which the class recites the Pledge of Allegiance. Instead of holding their hands over their hearts, they hold their arms out in what looks like a Nazi salute!

As he gets deeper into the mystery, he discovers that the virtual reality exists within another virtual reality. If I'm not mistaken, at the end he meets the man who is responsible for keeping the machine running.

But this guy, obviously a BAD guy, takes this BIG knife and stabs this woman in the back. She's obviously in extreme pain, but he says something about how it could be much worse (or that he could paralyze her) and then he twists the knife or something -- and you can hear the bones in the spine snap and then her knees buckle. We don't know whether or not she survives. Does anyone know the name of the movie?

227003508	movie	extra	imdb	SOLVED: Two questions: Water-tight plane and self-repairing house. A plane lands in the water but remains water-tight as it sinks to the bottom. People inside wait for rescue. I seem to remember it was a 747 - I have a recollection of upstairs flooding slowly and water running down the stairs. I think it's one of the ""Airport"" series, but I might be wrong. The second film is more vague. A house repairs itself. For instance, a family member comments that a light bulb has blown, but the house repairs it without them having to change it. At one point, the house decides it wants a new coat of paint and sheds the shingles from the roof like a snake-skin. Colour, 70s, US, I believe. Thanks in advance!

227017670	movie	extra	imdb	French African's Last Day.... A while back, I saw a film set in some part of Africa where they speak French. It is quite a recently made movie, judging by the clothes I would say it was made within the last 10 - 15 years. It featured a black man who wanders around a city in Africa, not saying much, and just encountering different people - Some that he knows. It turns out that he has only 1 day left to live. It is a very stylish movie, and in one scene he is in an art gallery (I think) and sees a very attractive black woman. They circle each other around the room without speaking, then they sit and talk. At one point we see 3 children dancing in the middle of a busy street. Near the end, he goes to a house, and watches a very angry woman hanging out some washing. She totally ignores him. He follows here into her house and just sits down watching her doing housecleaning, etc. Until nightfall. He then tries to touch her and she gives him the brush-off. Later on they are in bed together. I think the two women may be his ex lovers. Not sure about this though. I didn't get to see the end, and all I remember about the title is that it had the word ""Vie"" (Life) in it. Does anyone recognise this film???

227025002	movie	extra	imdb	Western that starts in a barber shop on TMC or AMC last Saturday SOLVED. I was half asleep early Saturday morning last week and the TV was on either AMC or TCM. I am pretty sure this scene was the very beginning of the movie but could be wrong. It was a western, in color, probably from the 60s. There was very little or no dialogue for the ten minutes i watched, basically two bad guys come into a barber shop stuff shaving cream in a kids mouth or the barbers mouth along with the brush, they make sure they are quiet, one of the bad guys pretends to be the barber when the ""target"" guy comes in and sits in the barber chair wanting a shave and a cut. The whole ploy was to cut the guys neck i believe and kill him with the razor but that got debunked because someone under the chair was holding a gun to the guy out of site while several other bad guys i assume stood outside on guard and watched through the window. Basically the plan falls apart and the guy that was setup to be killed gunned down everyone and gets out of there alive and i fell back asleep for a while, i woke back up like 30 minutes later to a guy in a pond messing with a fly or something catching and then letting it go..and eventually he catches a fish with his bare hands. Again no dialogue. I thought will all this information it would be easy to find but I'm coming up empty on google and trying to find tv listings from last week. FYI it is NOT High Plains Drifter Thank you all in Advance!...i have a feeling this one will be quick.

227134793	movie	extra	imdb	Movie from late 50's or the 60's SOLVED. I recently saw this movie late one night in the early hours of the morning it was from either the late 50's or from the 60's. I originally thought it starred Rock Hudson and Doris Day but i don't think it was them, although the lead actor and actress do look similar. I remember the movie was in colour and in American English. I remember very peculiar details of the movie. There is a woman in an apartment i remember she wore a lot of pink and blue i think. She seems to spend a lot of time in this apartment for some reason. Somehow she meets a man, and she doesn't seem to care for him, but he likes her a lot. I believe he pretends to be someone else by stealing money and acting rich. I remember this scene were he pops into a shop or bank from a sewer drain and thats how he steals the money, when he opens the drain lid he is in the middle of the shop/banks floor. The man does play a naive character when he is himself. He had short brown hair. He then would try and court the woman by pretending to be rich, while when he pretended to be himself he was less pretentious and courageous he would fight people to defend the woman, which was a quality the woman liked she thought he was sweet for being like that and trying to help her. The majority of this is done in the apartment were the woman lives. The woman may have been involved with the mob or something like that cos he wants to marry her but she says she can't leave the apartment where she is at. I do believe their is a time jump as well during the movie. The woman had short blonde hair and the place the man steals from is across the street from the apartment she lives in. Their is the distinct possibility that their were 2 of the man like a lookalike. I remember in the end he escapes with her through that drain in the shop and ends up in a city river canal. It was a comedy drama. Any ideas what this movie may be? thanks ahead of time.

They call him Calamacho or something like that in the movie.

227142246	movie	extra	imdb	Rich guy pretends to be poor guy. Hi All, I vaguely recall a film where a rich guy, presumably one used to living the high life, attempts to see how the other half lives by posing as a ""normal"" person. The only reference I have for this film is a scene where he is seen selecting his new car from a line up of used cars that have been select by his staff. They attempt to get him to pick a newer/safer car but he ultimately chooses a real old banger because he prefers its style. I'm not 100% on this bit, but there may be a sub-plot element in the same film where some of his subordinates attempt to stage a coup by using a lookalike to replace him, insinuating that the fake is in fact the real version and the real guy is an imposter. I know this is incredibly vague but, any ideas? Thanks in advance.

It was a '70's horror picture that (I think) involved a killer at a hotel or who ran a hotel or resort perhaps in the mountains. I read that the film's marketing gimmick was that it was shot and then assembled in sequences that were split screen showing ostensibly what was happening in two places at once sort of like some of that stuff De Palma used to do.

227202204	movie	extra	imdb	Polish movie. i saw the movie around 2012 so it can be from early 2000's. In polish audio i believe with english subtitles in colour. I remember it was about some blonde boy around 10 maybe who is constantly asking about his dad to his mum who is hardly ever at home. The boy seems to spendsa lot of time at a small town train station. They live in what seems to be a small town. Although in one of the scenes his mother has a job interview and takes him with her she is fairly young probably in her 30's i think she also had blonde hair. Well she takes him to this real corporate building were she has the job interview, with a suit CEO business type man. He seems to be happy with her studies and says that her chances are good. The mother had asked the boy to wait outside the building in the car park. When the man is walking her out he sees the boy taking a piss on a car which turns out to be his. He tells the receptionist to call the police or something and i think the mother at that point realises she has to say something or else the boy will get in trouble so she says that its her son. I don't remember if the man still wants to give her a job but the woman is not happy later with the boy.

227226913	movie	extra	imdb	Christmas Movie (SOLVED). I remember a kid writes a letter to Santa, and his grandma throws the letter in fire when she thought he wasn't looking, but actually he was. This really upsets the kid, and he stops believing in Santa Claus, or something like that. At the end of the movie it's revealed that it was some kind of old way of giving letters to Santa, and it turns out Santa was real and the kid got his wish. I'm pretty sure the movie was from the 90's. Anyone?

I can't remember much else but I'm eager to watch it again for nostalgic reasons. Can anybody help?

Hi guys: I want to know the name of a Chinese (or Korean actually I don´t remember)movie that I saw about 8 - 10 years ago in a crappy VHS copy. I remember very few things about this movie for example, one of the main characters had massive wings with some metallic feathers. Additionally, all the guys who wanted to become heroes (or something with superpowers) had to climb a big mountain with a lot of staves on it, when they find the staff that belongs to them, they were able to train and obtain their superpowers, like the guy with the metallic wings. I can´t give more details because I can´t remember more about the movie. If someone know something about that movie please help me!!! Thank you!
227303732	movie	extra	imdb	Movie about Gun Safety--SOLVED. Me and my mom have been wondering about a movie, it came out in the '80s, probably between 1984-1986. It was on the Super Channel back then. It was about two boys, one was 14 and the other was about 10. They were going to go target practicing or to shoot rabbits or something and they were climbing over a fence. When the older one climbed over, nothing happened but when the younger one did, the gun fell off and shot the younger boy. The rest of the movie, the parents blamed the older boy and he blamed himself. We are not sure who the actors are in the movie, which makes it impossible to find. It was NOT a TV movie or straight to video.
227309393	movie	extra	imdb	British comedy series, circa late 90's? Please help.... Hello you gorgeous, knowledgable, but mostly gorgeous INTK people, I have a question and it goes like this: I'm looking for this spoof news comedy series that was on somewhere around 1997 - 2001. It was similar to 'KYTV' (if anyone remembers that!) and 'The Day Today' but this one came a bit later. It's not 'Brass Eye' either. The one I'm thinking of came between 'KYTV', 'The Day Today' and 'Brass Eye', it may not have even been a BBC programme. Possibly ITV or channel 4? It was definitely on terrestrial telly so either channels 1-4. It wasn't as funny or as satirical as the three comedies I've listed above and it may have been rather a flop but I recall this really funny skit where this 'showbiz reporter' type would interviw (fictional) film producers/actors/directors and fawn over how great he thought their films were, then, after the actor or whatnot left the studio he would give his real opinion and start slagging the film off. I remember 1 where, after sucking up to a particular director or actor he said something like; ""this film was so bad that it made me want to scoop my eyes out and stuff them in my ears so I didn't have to see or hear anymore of this crap film""! I think he looked a bit like James May, longish lank hair and a foppy look about him. Sorry, I've been rambling but I wanted to explain everything I can remember. Anyone recall this programme? Get it watched.

I've pinned the year down to when we first got lovefilm, 2011, and I was looking for films to order, and made a list of new releases, so probably 2011-2012. This was a Ganster movie, set I think in croatia. And it had a remixed version of Lakme Flower Duet in the trailer, it was really amazing, but I cannot for the life of me find that remix, or the film. I think the title was non-English, and possibly the word money was in the title - it was listed on IMDB. It is not listed in Leo Delibes list of credits on imdb either. If anyone has any idea, I'd be amazed, and very grateful! As far as the trailer goes I vaguely remember stacks of euros, maybe a blonde man, suits, maybe some sort of garden party/reception followed by lots of violence? Thank you!

An old comedy movie from the 70s or very early 80s, in which the opening credits start with a man coming out of his front door and vandazing the next door neighbours front door and then goes back inside. The next door neighbour then comes out of their front door and immediately blames the next neighbour along so he does something to their front door and then goes back inside.

227359212	movie	extra	imdb	The woman threw her girl through the window to save her !(Solved). I watched a movie in the late eighties(I guess)but I only remember some scenes. A woman(police or FBI)was involved somehow in crime related issues. She had a daughter. The woman was really skilled and fearless against the gangsters. In a scene, she was attacked in a high building where there is no escape. She worried about her little girl. In no time, She looked for a haven for her girl and saw a room with a bed in the next building. She took her girl and threw her away into the room in the next building. The girl landed safely on the bed. The woman then overcame the gangsters. In another scene and after a vicious fight, the woman lost consciousness on the street. Her girl approached and whispered "" get up and don't be silly"". The mother got up and overcame the gangsters. At the end of the movie, the woman appeared retired or so,living very far away with her man and daughter in a house in the open. While preparing a meal, she recalled her manual skills with knives during preparing salad and..all of sudden she threw the tomato and the knife in a very skillful way to get the tomato stabbed with the knife on the wall. Her man was watching and seemed both terrified and overwhelmed. (The mouth of the woman in the movie is very similar to the mouth of Melissa George in Triangle). Any help with the movie name ?!

227376812	movie	extra	imdb	English TV Series about Barrister - SOLVED !!!. This Show is set in England (probably made by BBC or ITV or similar) and features a Barrister in the era where the articled clerk is writing with a Quill Ink Pen - ie circa 1890's (I recall this show was shown in Australia on the ABC late at night in about 1985 - but I only ever got to watch part of one episode) I recall a scene where the Barrister is walking down timber internal stairs in Chambers and is met by his articled clerk and they inspect the ledger to see what fees he has on pending briefs. In another scene I recall that it is during the era where Barristers have to be a bit circumspect when addressing Judges in the Court and he is ""rude"" to the Old English Style Judges and gets harshly criticised by the Bench. He is portrayed as a particularly passionate and somewhat zealot of a barrister. Without his wig the actor had longish brown hair and was young for a barrister ie about 25-28 years of age. I cannot remember much more about it except to emphasise this is set in the days of Horse and Buggies Cheers Iain from Australia

227391532	movie	extra	imdb	Really strange late night TV show set in suburbia (solved by Marla). This is a real shot in the dark as the details are quite vague in my mind. I only saw a few episodes late at night about 7-10 years ago (it was new at the time) so forgive me if I get some things wrong or don't have enough detail. I want to say it's a Canadian show but that could just be because the humor made me think of Kids in the Hall at the time. May actually be an American show but seemed foreign because of its originality, Australian maybe? Anyway it involved what looked like typical suburban housewives that go about committing major crimes, murdering people for silly reasons, having nutty sexual exploits, and acting like the mob. I remember it being quite colorful and quirky, the humor in it was just so funny as these really outlandish subplots kept turning everything on its head. Perhaps at least one of the housewives had an odd hairstyle like a beehive? Another was a dominatrix perhaps? Sorry for such scant details, hopefully it will ring a bell with someone.

227409994	movie	extra	imdb	2 films I'm trying to identify.... (Solved!). Hello, There are 2 films I'm trying to remember the names of that I remember watching a long time ago on TV, I'm hoping someone on this board can tell me what they are from what bits of them I can remember. The first film was a horror/thriller of sorts (it might of been either an Australian or British production), and I remember watching it on CBS Late Night, IIRC, back in the 80s. It revolves around this one sinister character who somehow gets involved with an affluent family (a lodger or something to that effect), and the film's plot begins with an eerie image of his face appearing on the family's kitchen floor (even the maid tries to remove it to no avail). The fellow seems to enter the lives of and brainwashes the family in a way. In the most memorable scene, he removes a rotting tooth from the matriarch of the family in a very unusual way by feeling around her jaw while pushing the tooth out of her gums without even penetrating her skin, and keeps massaging it through her skin from her jawline, through her arm, and down to under the skin of her finger while he has her in a hypnotized, near-catatonic state. I remember one of her lines while this is going on: ""the pain is orange"" or ""the pain feels orange"". To end the scene, the man takes out a cleaver from the kitchen drawer, and chops off her finger where the tooth is embedded and eats it, to the shock and outrage of the rest of the family!!!!!! I'm sure someone knows what this unusual film is? The second film is one I saw on HBO eons ago that I think came out in the early 80s--I vaguely remember the title, it's two surnames, like ""Barnes & Higgins"" or something like that. It's plot revolves around the two title characters kidnapping a young boy and, IIRC, holding him for ransom. I do distinctively remember one of the lines uttered by one of the kidnappers: ""What's the last thing going through a bug's mind when it hits a car windshield? Its ass!"" Anyone know what these films are? -Ryan

227412520	movie	extra	imdb	2 Older Movies I'd like to put names to-Solved-thx everybody!. Any help with these is appreciated: First is a film I caught on TV in the late 70's or early 80's. Horror/Sci-fi genre, a group of people are trapped together (I think they may be in a small train station) after being exposed to either a biological weapon or some unknown virus that causes one's brain tissue to expand as soon as they fall asleep. Had the most graphic gross-out FX I'd seen at that age on TV as the people's skulls cracked open. Film was in color and looked no older than mid-70's. Second is a film (or possibly an episode of a show) about two captured soldiers in WWII (I think they were downed pilots, not sure) who are held captive in a Nazi officer's basement well past the end of the war when they finally escape. I recall a scene at the end where one of the soldiers looks up and see's a jet airplane flying overhead, but that's about it. I thought one of the actors was a young Robert Redford but nothing on his list sounded like this. Believe it was also in color.

227429702	movie	extra	imdb	Name of a film about a man who raises a baby gir, a rob and car accident. Alright, so the film I'm looking for (I think) was made between 1980 and 2000. It was about a man finding a baby girl and raising her (I think it was cold in the snow at the start of the film when he found her). Also, the same man got robbed some collection money pieces at the start of the film, and the robber die in a car accident in a lake or something. Years later, when the girl was older, her real father noticed about his daughter and want to get her back. then the father go in court with the man who raised her and for some kind of reasons, the real father is about to win because he is richer than the man who raised the girl. Then people found a car with the money pieces robbed with the skeleton of the robber in a dry lake or something, so the man who raised the girl get richer and can keep the girl. Hopefully it's not too confusing, hope I can get the title of this film, thanks a lot!

Probably made within the last ten years, maybe fifteen, this is a movie about a man who checks into the hospital for a ""simple procedure."" It was just starting on the TV in my hospital room as I awakened groggily from anesthesia following my own not-so-simple procedure. My veins were also sloshing with IV painkillers, so no wonder it isn't a movie I clearly recall; *thankfully*!! So he wakes up after this routine surgery to find he's had a leg amputated. It gets worse from there. A sadistic - nurse's aide? orderly? - a huge, muscular guy, comes to his room routinely to inflict gruesome tortures. He (?) also wheels him to an abandoned, off-limits part of the hospital where he sees visions, or ghostly ""reenactments ,"" of horrible things that went on there many years ago. I believe his family is told at some point, when/as he can't communicate, that he's comatose, then paralyzed, then ""locked in."" I also believe they're convinced to forget about him. There's also a very attractive nurse who, I believe, ""takes advantage of him."" I don't know if the ending actually happened, or was a dream, or fantasy of his, and won 't mention it anyway, as it was a pretty good movie that others may want to watch.

Hi experts, I need help remembering a horror movie that aired on The Movie Channel from the 1980-1985 time period. Very similar to Friday the 13th, but not mainstream (as far as I can remember). A killer chased around some high school or college students. At one point, a heroine fell alseep with her head on the steering wheel of a car (blaring the horn). She wakes up and the killer either jumps up on the car and breaks the windshield or she rams the car into him into some gates, presumably the gates to the place her & her friends were exploring. There was also a beheading of a female earlier in the movie, other people stumble upon her body & head with rats crawling around, I want to say it was in a cave-like dwelling. That is really all I remember, and curiosity is getting the best of me! Anyone?

I remember a trailer for a hunting movie last year or so. Only I can't see that it has come out, anywhere. And i cant for my life remember the title. It is set in New Zealand or Australia and I believe the hunt is for some legendary animal thought to be exctinct. The hunter is somewhat senior, in his 50-60s. 2nd movie is from late 80s or early 90s. War movie is not a correct description, but is the closest I can think of. I saw it on cable-tv. The title was somthing like ""The Long Journey Home"". It is set in Vietnam(or close) and is about a bunch of orphan kids (age 5-15). They are fleeing over a great distance over land and water. Half the kids die before they get picked up by a chopper in the end. All the cast is asian, but I believe the movie is from the US. I cant remember if they spoke english or vietnamese(only remeber the subtitles.) I have spent many hours on the net searching for these, but no luck. Any help is highly appreciated. :)

For some reason I always thought it was in a scene of Jonathan Creek but have recently re watched. Now thinking it was ITV? Thanks!

227489926	movie	extra	imdb	SOLVED! BBC detective series set in Earth-Moon space. This is driving me mad. I remember a short lived (or maybe just a mini-series) show by the BBC set in Earth - Moon space. The main character was a detective of some sort, a space policeman rather than a PI sort. I remember he had some sort of advanced hand-held computer. I think it was implied his father stole it. And a character wanting to come aboard a Russian craft and him saying, ""It's been 10 years since that Glasnost rubbish"" when the Russians welcome him. Made in 1989 or 90 from that exchange, I think. Thanks in advance!

227522635	movie	extra	imdb	Girl Stalks + Kills Girl Cable Film. Hi people. Can anyone try helping me of what the name of this movie is that I'm about to describe please? I think it was made in the early or mid 2000's and it was aired on cable. It's about a girl who loses out to another girl in a beauty pageant (I think or a beauty show) and ever since then, the girl who lost constantly stalks and ends up killing the winning girl. I do remember that the winning girl was a red head and lived with her mom and the loosing (yet psychotic) girl was a blonde. The blonde had a girlfriend with very short dark hair and a guy friend also. The scene of how the red head girl dies, her mom gets a fake call from her job telling her that she needs to come to work today which leaves her daughter alone in the house. As her mom is on her way to work, someone rings the doorbell and the daughter opens it up. A masked person breaks inside and attacks her which ends up in tragedy. If anyone has any info of the movie I'm talking about, please let me know what it's called. Thank you.

227557013	movie	extra	imdb	Need title of a movie please-very difficult to solve!. Hi, I posted this a few weeks ago, but no-one could find the answer to it. I'm looking to find the title of a movie. It's an American film from around the late 1980's/early 1990's. It's about a man who travels from town to town committing murders. I seem to remember it having a scene where a body turns up near some rocks next to a River. There is also a scene where a blonde woman in a white nightie gives the murderer a bottle of Budweiser then rides him in a white nightie. I seem to think it may have been called The Traveller or Visitor, but can't find anything. The man has dark hair, I would say at the time late thirties/early forties. I think the woman knows the police detectives, but believes the man is innocent. It's not the Minus Man, The Drifter, The Nature Of The Beast, Dust Devil or Clay Pigeons. It could have been a TV movie. I saw it here in the U.K. on BBC television between 1992 and 1994. Can anyone help please?

227586285	movie	extra	imdb	Movie title needed (not much to go on) SOLVED. I am looking to find the name of a film I did not see and do not know much about. I am looking for a friend who swears he saw this movie and he cannot recall the name. This is what we know. -The movie is in the horror genre. -The movie was filmed in back and white. -The movie was possibly a French production. -The movie was probably made in the last 10 years. What follows is all he could recall of any scenes in the movie. Please be advised that the description is graphic and I do apologize for the crudeness of it, but it is all we have to go on. The film focuses on two middle aged women and one man. The women are mentally disturbed in some way. They somehow capture the man and tie him up and begin to torture him. At some point in the film one of the women removes one of the mans body parts and masturbates with it. She has a very large bush (lots of pubic hair.) Quite possibly the man does not die and one woman kills the other. The surviving woman and man end up living together. That's really all I have. Whoever gets this is probably a movie genius. Good luck.

I remember being terrifed of this one scene from this movie with a 30-something white guy living in Japan, probably early 80s but maybe late 70s. I believe the house, with those paper sliding doors, was haunted by spirits or the spirits didn't like a white guy living in Japan. The one scene I remember most clearly is when there are crabs all around the house. I have a phobia of crabs! I think there was a scene where they superimposed faces of the spirits onto the crabs to show they were possessed crabs.

227649557	movie	extra	imdb	Kids TV show I watched around '89-'91. Live action. *SOLVED*. Hey, Looking for a kids live action tv show I watched in the very late eighties or very early nineties. It was on early in the morning at the weekend. I'm pretty sure it was on channel 4 in the UK, though my impression is that it was an American or Canadian show. Anyway I only ever watched one or two episodes - not sure why - so I have a very vague memory of it. The biggest clue I have is that the main character, who was a young girl (with ginger hair I think), would narrate her thoughts, much like the style of The Wonder Years or My So-called Life. In one episode I recall her saying something like ""diary entry one thousand and twenty seven"", or some such number, which suggests to me that each episode she was either narrating what she was writing in her diary, or she made frequent references to diary entries. If you know the show then the above is the biggest clue I would imagine so it probably won't help to describe the 2 scenes I remember but I'll do it anyway: She is sitting at the kitchen table in the morning. Her mother is cooking porridge/oatmeal/oats and she dumps it in a bowl in front of the girl. The girl is narrating about how gross it is or whatever. The other scene is the girl in a park and maybe on a slide and this is where she makes a reference to her diary entry in her narration. Any help is much appreciated. Thanks.

227676116	movie	extra	imdb	Looking for the title of a horror film (2000s?). Hey there. This might come across as odd, but I am looking for the title of a movie that I have NOT seen. What happened was that I was browsing through IMDB and happened to find a thread where some people referred to a film the scariest they had ever seen. I then visited the IMDB site of that film and remember some details but have forgotten the name of it. I intend to watch it at some point. Needless to say that I have been doing a lot of searching to find that title again but with no result. List of the details (I might remember some ones wrong): -possibly made in the 2000s or 2010s -psychological horror -NOT at teenage horror film or gore/splatter -I think it has a female lead -I think it has suburban or similar setting -possibly supernatural elements -had a decent IMDB rating (I think it was 6-7) What I find odd is that there are lots of horror films that I like and are considered at least decent, such as 1408, but which do not appear that much on ""best horror"" lists. I guess this is a similar case since I haven't found the film although I have browsed through quite a many horror movie lists. All attempts of helping are much appreciated.

227678483	movie	extra	imdb	80s thriller about a child porn ring. I saw it around the mid-80s. I thought Ken Foree was in it but can't find it on his page. It was low budget. The Ken Foree-looking guy (big, good-looking black guy) is a cop who's trying to bust this ring of kiddie porn makers. The main guy is a fat white guy probably in his 40s who tries to be nice to the kids but can't help being verbally cruel. The movie starts with a little boy, btwn 5-8, being forced to go into a room where there's a grown woman in a teddy sitting on the bed. He is supposed to have sex with her, and he starts to cry. The woman sort of strokes his hair and tells him it's going to be ok. Mercifully we don't see anything more. The cop lives with his sister, a pretty but sort of loud-mouthed girl. They have a pet ferret that she hates at first but then grows attached. There is a scene where she's dancing in the kitchen with a Walkman on, drinking something and petting the ferret. The scene is sort of funny because of her dancing. Meanwhile her brother is fighting or something, but she can't hear it because of the Walkman. In the end, they rescue a bunch of kids and they all live happily ever after. The opening scene has always haunted me.

227679188	movie	extra	imdb	Late 70s/early 80s exploitation/drive-in flick. I don't remember this being anywhere but the drive in. I saw it around 1983 or so. The acting, sets, dialog and sound are all terrible. It centers around a young blonde female singer (attractive shampoo-commercial type) who is driving around the country playing in dive bars. I don't remember if she plays a guitar or not. One of the lyrics she sings is about how she wants to ""clap my hands and dance."" It is an excruciatingly bad performance. So one morning while she's driving, I believe she hits a pedestrian who is all bloodied up and stabbed. She stops and goes into a house and finds a family all murdered and crap. There's a teenage kid who looks at her really weirdly and he has a shotgun. She says ""Hullo"" (made me laugh) and starts saying something about needing to use the phone...something happens, he fires the gun, she hits him or something and he ends up in a coma. This is some dust-bowl backwater, so she gets arrested for killing the family and gets thrown in jail. Of course, they are up to some kinky, trashy sh*t in the jail. There is a psychiatrist who is trying out some new kind of therapy that involves destroying the person's ego and then building them back up, but the shrink is doing this because he has them doing something illegal (like murder or robbery or something). There are nudity, a shower scene, a masturbation scene, horny guards, etc. There is also another prisoner named Rita who the shrink has done his nastiness to already, and she's all childlike and traumatized and ends up dead, I think. Then the teenager gets out of the coma and confesses, and I THINK the singer shoots the shrink and then is let out of prison. The last scene is of the singer back on a dumpy stage smiling, singing about how she can now ""clap my hands and dance."" It was one of those flicks that was so bad it was good. Would love to see it again.

227682909	movie	extra	imdb	1970's Movie Re: Witchcraft.... Thing is THINK it's a 1970's movie, I'm pretty sure it is. It's a film that I saw on TV years ago, it seems to be an obscure movie regarding witchcraft but I wouldn't call it a horror movie. It was about a young woman in a small town who people believed was a witch. You know the usual things, they whispered behind her back, all that stuff. But for the most part she basically lived among them in peace like everyone else, they tolerated her but they were afraid of her. This lady then meets a man from out of town who falls in love with her, he learns of the rumors and thinks it's absurd. One day while at a supermarket or some type of store he notices how everyone else just basically ignores the young woman and to poke fun at them he gestures with his hand and shouts ""ZAP!"" as if he was going to zap/cast a spell on someone, and everyone around him jumps and some people call him a whippersnapper because he was being a wise ass, etc. Needless to say, they did not appreciate it. To make a long story short, we do learn that this lady as we find out was someone who indeed had sold her soul to the Devil as she was dying & in pain so she was scared & accepted the deal he made. Not that she was evil or hurt anyone or had to hurt anyone as part of the deal, she just kept to herself & lived alone in peace. She related the story of what happened to the young man that she loved. She was close to death & as she lay dying she heard a man's voice inside of her head. He rattled off a bunch of names that he went by, but all I could remember is he said ""Momo"" It went something like this: ""I am so & so, I am Momo, I will spare your life, all that I ask is that when I come you know me"" something to that effect. At the end of the movie the girl somehow breaks the pact and starts to age & die, and then the man who loves her, he rushes to her side and the Devil again this time in a woman's voice talks to him inside his head, he basically says the same thing,& offers the man a deal to save her life and the girl goes ""nooo, don't"" but he does it anyway she is spared, turned young again and I guess they live happily ever after as a couple of after that. Tried to describe this movie the best I could. Hopefully someone, somewhere recognizes something of what I wrote and can help. Thank you in advance.

227735943	movie	extra	imdb	The father enclosed his son in a dead body.(Solved). I saw this movie once, in the nineties perhaps. It is about a psychopathic doctor whose IQ is somewhere in the space(according to the narrator in the beginning of the movie). The doctor commits crimes. His examination tools are so harmful. If he uses a tool to examine or to look inside the ear, the tool seems extra long and sharp such that it can stab the inner ear of the victim. In a scene, the doctor is shown as a boy with his father. Both of them are crying for the death of the boy's mother, who is laying cold on a table.(in a morgue may be) The father is mixing his crying with smiles. The boy is looking the father in the eyes and doing the same. So the father was a crazy doctor and so was the son. The father had put the son inside a dead body, stitched and delivered the boy to safety(somewhere outside). I hope somebody knows the name of this movie. Thanks.

SCENE 1;the girl takes the boy back to the home,she ran away from.i cant remember if she went back to steal money or collect her things,but her father/stepfather arrives home and there an altercation between the 3 of them before the teenagers escape.i think the girl is being abused by the stepfather which is why she ran away.

SCENE 3;the girl and boy are out on the street at night,when suddenly the aforementioned scuffy guy and his mates surround them with the intention of raping the girl.the girl makes some kind of quip about finding the guys willy,if they both look hard enough.i cant remember how the scene ends.

227749865	movie	extra	imdb	Need a movie ID (cartoon/real world movie). Caught the end of this movie years ago and would like to know the name. It is one of those movies where cartoon characters and real people interact, kind of like the movies Space Jam or Who Framed Roger Rabbit. However in this movie the toons could take on human form and humans could take toon form, I'm guessing under unique circumstances. There was a part where a human needed to quickly get to the roof of a building. He turned his arms into toon arms and stretched all the way up the building so he could pull himself up. The main villain was some toon woman. I'm not sure exactly what she was trying to do but I think she was trying to bring down the barrier separating the real world from the toon world, at least I think so. Two human detectives were pursuing her with the help of a couple of toons. One of the detectives was killed when the evil toon woman pushed him off a ledge. As her plan started to get underway the other detective took on some toon superhero form and stopped her. The good toons who helped the detectives took the dead detective's body back to the toon world with them. He was in love with a toon woman and they wanted to give her the chance to say goodbye. She is at first upset to see that he is dead but quickly asks if he was killed while the villainess was in human form or toon form. She started laughing after learning she was in toon form because if a real person is killed BY a toon they are brought back to life AS a toon. Within moments the detective was revived as a toon and they could be together. None of the usual cartoon characters like Bugs Bunny or Mickey Mouse were in this movie, at least not that I saw. Does this sound familiar to anyone?

When the protagonist discovers her secret she changes into a cat and attempts to maul him but he succeeds in getting an amulet around her neck breaking her power.

Sherif chastises him. Somehow he gets recognized by this big team and picked up as a rider - I think it's an Italian team. I remember therir team colors being red and black. He and his friend travel Europe competing in races. His moto tech is named ""Fuj"" (Fujiyama, or Fujasaki or something). Ends up a bitter rivalry between himself and the lead team rider. At some point in the movie there's a magazine cover of the two of them racing that says ""teammates or rivals"". Gets kicked off the team somehow, or maybe quits and goes back home to the country and builds an ""American made"" motorcycle to race his rival in a big race. They rehire Fuj to help tune their bike. They show up to the race with the bike in a horse trailer and the guard says ""this ain't no horse race"" to which they reply ""this ain't no horse"".

227872101	movie	extra	imdb	SOLVED! Outer space sci-fi tv series imported into USA in early 1970s. Someone out there who's an expert in science fiction movies and television please let me know. I remember a television science fiction series back in the early 70s and I believe it was imported from the UK. This is the scenario: Earth had been totally devastated and left radioactive and uninhabitable after World War III. The survivors combined their remaining resources to create an unbelievably massive space 'ark', the length of a country county. That is the backdrop. Over the succeeding years, the space ark's inhabitants were divided into tribes living in successive sections of the traveling space ark. These different peoples living in different sections appeared to be living at the level of the 19th century, some with vestiges of the 20th century. During each episode, a traveling group of two men, a woman, and a young boy journeys through each ark section, meeting each section's tribe or 'society' and interacting with them, sometimes at peril because most of the time the travelers were not welcome and the local 'society' or tribe might be openly hostile and suspicious. I could not really understand what this traveling group were looking for. They just seemed to be traveling straight through the endless space ark, looking for, 'something', possibly the secret of the space ark itself. One of the two men carried a crossbow for defense but I never recalled him shooting it. The group got into danger during each episode but always managed to talk their way out of it or make the right friends who rescued them or opened the way forward for them. Each episode began with this group entering a new inhabited section of the space ark and meeting its tribal inhabitants. Each section was HUGE. Then the episode was about the group trying to meet people and gather information, getting into trouble, getting out of it and at the end of the episode departing the ark section. Oftentimes the group made close friends who sometimes saved their lives or else provided critical information for the group to continue their journey so the end of the episode might be a bittersweet farewell to new friends, or else after escaping danger, a lonely exit into the next ark section.
227874225	movie	extra	imdb	Looking for a weird movie - Solved. Was in and out of a room that had a weird little movie playing so I caught bits and pieces throughout. This couple found themselves trapped on the junkyard-like property of a weird and twisted old man. I'm not entirely sure how these people got there but the obvious point of the movie was for them to escape. I don't know the main characters' names so I'll call them John and Jane. The old man seemed to enjoy tormenting the couple. One odd thing about the man was that apparently his nose was removable. Living with the old man was a very strong red-headed woman who in one scene was carrying Jane over her head. There was also a police woman living on the property and two very large, very fat and ugly babies. There's one scene where the red-head attempted to throw Jane into a fire pit but the babies pleaded with her to put Jane down, presumably to play with her. Eventually John and Jane managed to escape. They went to the police and told them everything that happened there. The incredulous police asked the two to accompany them to the junkyard so they could identify the old man and his cohorts before they arrested them. The police went to the junkyard in force and the couple knocked on the door to lure the old man out. When he emerged he pretended to be some sweet old man. When the couple try to tell him it is over he points behind them and the couple are horrified to learn that the entire police force were friends of the old man. It looked like John and Jane would be trapped in hell again when all of a sudden something underground started to explode and the ground started to fall out beneath everyone's feet. John and Jane escape as almost everyone else is killed. The movie ends with John waking up in front of a TV that's reporting the aftermath of the explosions. A reporter questions one of the survivors and it is revealed to be the old man. He claims he is going to stay with ""relatives"" now. The old man has John's driver's license, flashing it in front of the TV camera and showing off to John that he knows where he lives. A horrified John runs straight through a wall and leaves a human shaped hole. I know these fragments aren't much to go on but does anyone have any idea what I'm talking about?

227886409	movie	extra	imdb	Foreign film about despression and isolation. I've been trying to find a film i saw many years ago. It was a foreign film (french i believe) that appeared to had been shot in the 70's or 80's and was approximately 3 hours in length. It had beautiful cinematography and many long takes with the camera in a fixed position, typically showing the kitchen of the main character's apartment. There were also long stretches of film with no score and no dialogue The main character is a mother who's son has grown and moved out so she lives alone. The film can be difficult to watch since it mainly portrays the main character's increasing loneliness, isolation, depression and her attempts to find meaning in her life. If I recall correctly, she tries her hand at prostitution near the film's end and eventually commits suicide. Sadly, I cannot recall much more about the film but i'd very much like to find it.

227904746	movie	extra	imdb	SOLVED. Trying to remember the title of a film I saw a few years ago.. I can't remember if I saw this on TV or watched the DVD at a friends house or hell it might have even been at a film festival or something. But it was only a few years ago, like maybe 2010 or so and it wasn't very good which is probably why I can't remember the circumstances under which I saw it but I kinda wanna see it again because the idea interested me and I think I may have been too quick to judge it. But anyway, I can hardly remember the details but I'll try and describe what I recall best I can! It was about this girl, who like worked in a convenience store or something and she was really lonely but then met this guy who she liked. It turned out I think that she was too ticklish for sex so the guy wouldn't stay with her. In response she went out and tried to have sex with a bunch of people so she would experienced enough for this guy... It's kinda ridiculous, but I wanna see it again! Anyone know what the film is??? Googling the details has proved fruitless. The REAL 2011 4th of July Rumble Winner
227909676	movie	extra	imdb	Monster on oil rig (NOT The Intruder Within) SOLVED. Early 2000s, low budget. Has a semi-famous actor in it (kind of like a Ron Perlman, but not him). I am not sure where the monster comes from, I think it gets pulled up from the ocean floor maybe? But it's not noticed straight away. It stalks around killing off the cast one by one. I think there is some huge storm going on at the same time and they can't leave the rig. The only other thing I remember is the movie was REALLY poorly lit. Almost every scene was too dark. ""Worthington, we're being attacked by giant bats!""
227911198	movie	extra	imdb	A few films I'm looking for (SOLVED). The first, and probably most obscure, is an oldish horror drama I watched as a young teenager. It was black and white, and the first half mostly involved a man living with his overprotective mum. I think, if I recall, she kills people. He ends up killing her by covering her face in cellophane. It was very oddly filmed, almost eraser head style. Will most likely be from the late 80s early 90s. I've never heard or seen anything about it since. It may have been foreign, I can't recall. Second might be easier, Spanish I think film about living in a bunker with these powerful spirits that chase them. Movie is focused mainly on a young bit, I think his name is Sasha. Twist at the end but don't want to give spoilers. Thanks to anyone who can help.

What was the movie where the person's brain kept growing and overwriting the emotional centers of the brain, getting more and more complex in the neural pathways until iut had overwritten all emotions for higher intelligence, doing away with all negative emotions then ultimately all emotions... Damn what was that from? A movie or tv show or something.... I think there was a synthetic drug used and he was going to completely lose his humanity, but they were able to create some kind of drug to counteract it and he became normal again before it was too late Not Star Trek episode with Barclay, it's a more recent thing. There's even a scene where they're discussing how at first it just made sense to overwrite emotions like pride and greed and jealousy, but after awhile it became too easy to overwrite all the other emotions... ~*~ http://www.jmberman.com

227917496	movie	extra	imdb	Australian AFL Movie.. Hi there, This is a tricky one, with not much to go on, but I don't suppose there are that many AFL movies out there. I remember seeing it as a mid-day movie, in the late eighties early nineties I think. It was about a local AFL team, and the thing that caught my attention is that it seemed to be filmed in Riverstone NSW as I can remember seeing what I thought were local sights, as I was living there at the time. Not much to go on, but any ideas appreciated. Cheers No Daniel Craig, I Expect You To Die.
227919394	movie	extra	imdb	Three headed dog in some sort of B-movie/Army of Darknes like flick... Hi. I remember seeing this movie on tv back in my childhood, guess it was the mid 90's. I'm pretty sure the movie was from the late 80's or early 90's - it had quite a late 80's/early 90's b-movie monster/horror/adventure feel to it, and seemed a bit inspired by movies like Evil Dead 2 and Army of Darkness. I really don't remember too many specific scenes, though it made a great impression on me. The stuff I recall best is from the beginning where the main character is driving in a deserted desert-like area with his girlfriend, when they suddenly are attacked by some sort of demonic warrior, who defeats them and kidnaps the girl. It most likely brings the girl to hell, because the main guy follows them, and it doesn't last long before he is standing in front of this gate that's guarded by Cerberus/a stop-motion animated three-headed monstrous chained dog, which he defeats and then proceeds on to battle other types of demonic creatures in his quest to save his girlfriend - mostly in a rather Ash-like way, with funny/medieval weapons and a shotgun, if I recall correct.. I don't recall much else, except that the movie had this grainy/yellow style, and it really was a real cool b-movie, with great cheesy effects, gore and dialog.. I really hope somebody can help, I've been wanting to see this movie again for ages. :) Yo!

227928776	movie	extra	imdb	Movie title help [Solved]. Dear forum members, I'm looking for the title of a movie which I only remember one scene from. One sees a camera team filming a woman dressed in white how she walks across a meadow (left to right of screen). The style of the people and surrounding is 60/70s hippie-ish. Along her path across the meadow, the woman passes by a few odd things. A team of men carrying a big mirror where the camera team is reflected in and filming itself (on purpose). A physician who gives shots to adults who then turn into children (the adult gets the shot, walks behind a rug which is held up, and a child jumps out on the other side of the rug). After a few people, the physician gives himself a shot to become a child. Another scene happening is a voluntary crucifixion. They guy is put on the cross and raised, but as he sees the woman dressed in white walking by, apparently changes his mind and wants to be taken down. There's only music playing in the background (I'm actually looking for the song title), no words are spoken, and the entire scene described above is maybe 20-30 seconds. The woman eventually walks up a little hill on the meadow and disappears behind it with kids following the woman. Thanks!

227974685	movie	extra	imdb	SOLVED Name of a British B-movie from the 60's(ish). Driving me mad trying to remember this one. Sorry but I've confused it with The Day the World Ended so there are only a few features I'm fairly sure of. -I think most of the population are simultaneously made unconscious somehow, so the film has a sort of recent apocalypse/holocaust sort of feel. -Various people end up in a very nice looking rural town or village. They hole up in what I think is either a pub or hotel in the centre. The idyllic locations might have featured quite prominently as I remember them well. -There's a little European sports car that features. -I think some aliens in big space suits turn up, or maybe they're robots. I remember a bulky and slow moving 'baddie' suddenly being in the village. -I think there was some sort of abandoned military facility or warehouse that they end up going to, but I could be wrong about this one. -I'd guess it was from the 60's but it could have been the 50's. Any thought much appreciated!

228028359	movie	extra	imdb	Help Identify obscure brit tv shows. there are 3 shows in particular i cannot remember the titles for and can only remember vague details of the story. any suggestions are appreciated. Show #1: all i really remember is the main character of the show has short dark brown hair (kind of looks like a stereotypical mechanic). the story takes place in blackpool, ensemble story. but the main plot is murder mystery in a comedy/thriller genre, very surreal though. i believe the main character has a shoot out in a gorilla suit towards the conclusion. confronting his long lost father or something? his mother was murdered perhaps. characters are bizarre for the most part almost in the vein of pyschoville type shows, mystery/intrigue themes. **SOLVED** Funland Show #2: creepy short stories, from medley of directors i would imagine. i only recall a couple of stories. one of them was exploring the killer cell phone theme, with a business man who can't live without his phone, then disover his phone is trying to kill him and his wife. another one was, a guy finds a brain in a jar and it speaks to him telepathically or something, the brain pretends to be his friend but ends up trying to kill him and steal his gf or something like that. and another was, a man and wife are trying to build an extension on their house, but the builders are unreliable and the wife has to make ridiculous amounts of tea for the builders, ends up accidentally killing one of them or something so the man and wife bury the builder under the patio?? Show #3: revolves around a couple of bouncers who get fired from their strip club or whatever. they end up travelling the countryside with a caravan no money and getting into mischief. its a pretty straight up comedy from memory. **SOLVED** max and paddy road to nowhere Show #4: revolves around a strip club owner or possibly just some kind of night club, the owner is in a wheel chair or some kind of disability. another straight comedy show, which mostly consist of terrible entertainment at this struggling strip bar/night club. all the patrons are like.. ugly for lack a better word and just generally droll people, more about surreal humour i guess. **SOLVED** pheonix nights If you have any suggestions as to what these titles might be please share!!

He laughs it off but later in the story he does end up having seven wives.

I don't remember anything about the cast or plot details, but I do remember it had something to do with a few members of a special forces team captured by the badguy (a warlord of some sort, I presume) along with hostages and the remainder of the team has to save them. The thing that sticks out in my mind is a fight between the hero and the villain's big tough guy, and there's a part where the hero ends up in a chair against the wall. There's a desk between him and the bad guy. And the bad guy is trying to crush him with the desk. From what I remember, it's pretty ridiculous because basically it came down to one guy pushing against the desk with his upper body, and the hero in a chair pushing against the same desk (to keep from getting crushed) with his feet. Also, the parts I saw took place in more of a desert setting. Any thoughts? Thanks in advance. --- Truffaut: Do dreams have a bearing on your work? Hitchcock: Daydreams, probably.

228138801	movie	extra	imdb	Old title. Hey, I am looking for two titles. The movies are quite old, but maybe some of you might of seen them. Here are my descriptions. Movie #1: It tells a story about a man in an asylum, which he entered after he had a car accident and suffered memory loss. Basically he was trying to escape the asylum. The had this futuristic white view, guards with white robes. The main character had longer hair with some bandages and scars on his head. There are also flashbacks of him before the accident, for example - him driving a cabriolet and showing a ring to his son and thus crashing into a truck. There was a scene in the asylum, where he beat the guards and one guard (or a patient) pleaded him for mercy by saying ""I have a family"". Movie #2: It has a sci-fi element of a professor, who somehow traveled in time to a wedding shot-out. He has this watch device, which can cure severe wounds and bring someone to life (if the wounds are not too severe). He saves the groom, who must find his fiance. Later on the professor dies in an explosion and gives a few more watches to the groom. The groom electrifies himself while holding to a bad guy and later the watch heals his wounds, so he could pursue in saving his fiance. Every time you have a near death experience, the watch automatically cures you and uses some sort of element (every watch had a few elements on it). The movie ends of the groom, the fiance and the antagonist having severe damages, just before that the groom shares the last watch with his fiance. At the very end the fiance and broom recover thus using the last elements of the watches, while the antagonist dies, because he did not have a watch on himself. I think both are B movies, somewhere from around 1990-2000. Anyone know what I'm talking about?

228150857	movie	extra	imdb	1990s early 2000s thriller title.. I saw this film on tv many years ago, never knew the title but would like to find out if anyone can help. It was quite similar to rear window in it's set up, though the person doing the watching (and then subsequent discovery of a crime) was a bit of a creep/pervert. I can't give a lot of info as I can't remember too well. But the main character spends a lot of his time spying on a lady who lives across the street from him. He thinks he witnesses her murder, calls the cops, then finds out that she is in fact not dead. Even though he definitely saw someone being killed. That's about the best I can do, which I know isn't much but any help would be great. I thought the main character was played by John Turturro, but since looking through his films on here I don't think it is. Thanks did you ever pick your feet in Poughkeepsie?

It turns out she is a former field operative, and ""the dancer"" is a Cuban general who they hope to get to defect.

228157920	movie	extra	imdb	Childhood Movie (Late 80's I think). There is a movie I have been looking for a super long time for and cannot find. I am hoping someone out there can help! I will give you what I remember and then keep my fingers crossed for an answer. So what I remember about the movie was it was like a medieval times setting or something like that, and there are 2 scenes I vaguely remember and this was on HBO or Cinemax really early in the morning (5am or so). There was one scene where it seems the hero and other people were being forced down some gigantic slide to their death at the bottom and somehow he climbed back up or something and escaped. The other scene I remember was there is a group of people or warrior walking in the forest at night and they get caught in a circle. The beings or creatures that surround them in this circle formation looked like man-bats or something. One of the guys tries to attack one of the things and all their wings are open, when he charges one of the creatures it closes its wings and sucks him dry and just a goo (maybe glowing green or something) falls at the creatures feet. I wish I knew more and I hope someone could help me, even valid guesses would be helpful as I don't know where to turn to for help anymore. I would assume it was a B movie or something and it kind of reminded me of a ""Jason and the Argonauts"" type theme but as I mentioned kind of medieval times based (hero was kind of like a he-man or something). Many many thanks in advance to whoever can help me!!!

The two in particular I'm looking for are these ones: -A classy upscale restaurant in which the ""entertainment"" is watching a naked man in a tank that's slowly filling with water until he drowns. It gets too much for one patron and she smashes the tank, saving the man's life. -A group of people stuck in a lift, and there's murderous ""things"" outside the lift (possibly in a multi-storey car park). I think they all end up killing each other in there, or some of them do anyway - stabbed in the neck, squashed on top of it, that sort of thing. Thanks in advance!

Sorry wish I had more info. Many thanks for any suggestions. Think the leading lady is a brunette.

I know that's not a lot to go on, and I may have mixed up some details (like it could actually be a female character, not a man)... but I do specifically remember the quote very similar to ""you guys will just have to figure this one out for yourselves"" in reference to the fact that he is deciding to go home to his family instead of staying at work. ---- My DVD collection: http://gendoikari.filmaf.com/owned?rc=1

228261618	movie	extra	imdb	horror movie late 80s possibly insect girl monster. So I've been trying to find out this movie.... I can't find anything on google, and the only thing I saw from this movie that really scared me was a sex scene involving a couple of teenagers (most likely high school, I think the guy was a jock) they were doing it on a cot (camp bed) nothing is revealed during this sex scene and the girl starts transforming into a bug or something, she is like in pain and her face is changing, her eyes are kind of coming out her sockets and she's screaming but the boy keeps going at it, until she grows 2 insects legs and both insect parts hit the guy in the neck and he stops moving. She wraps him in a cocoon and all you can see is the guy's face as she hides the cocoon into the closet. That's the only scene I can remember. If anyone know the title name... the closest thing I could find was ""Sick Girl"" from Masters of Horror but I don't think that's it.
228262732	movie	extra	imdb	Late 80's/early 90's horror shows. *UNSOLVED*. I saw this show a couple of times, but I only remember one episode. In each episode, there was the same young 20-something guy and girl.... There's a little boy who goes to visit another boy and play with him. This boy, who was a little older, lived in his own huge house alone and warned the other boy to never go into the cellar (or basement). The young man and woman suspect something is wrong with the kid who lives alone. Turns out he is a vampire who has to drink blood in order to stay alive. At the end the little boy goes into the basement (or cellar) and falls in there, getting trapped. The vampire kid goes there to try and get him out and.... I don't know, I think he's going to suck the blood of the young man or something...? Anyway the little boy begs the vampire kid to not kill anyone else, and the vampire kid turns into a skeleton and dies right then and there. Another show had one episode about a woman married to a French guy named Paul. She kept accusing him for cheating, which he denied repeatedly. By the end of the show she was convinced, but something happened.... I don't know he said something or.... whatever. Then the wife realizes that he was having an affair, and she grabs the steering wheel and steers the car off the road killing one, or both of them. Any help with either of these is appreciated.

228273551	movie	extra	imdb	Movie (solved). Hi, a scene from a movie it's been bugging me, I think it's a fairly known film so I doubt it will be very dificult. Basically there's this huge water tank where the killer puts his victims. There's a bench on it and he puts them there and when they wake up the water pours inside drowning them. I think it was used at the beginning of the film with a woman, who dies, and then with the main character or the main character's girlfriend, something like that. I seem to remember that the water tank filled itself automatically, the killer wasn't there, and secondly, I have the feeling it was underground in the middle of a desert. Many thanks.

After the war the son tracks down each of the soldiers, and kills them one by one. He kills them in creative ways.

228350978	movie	extra	imdb	Italian/Spanish Horror Movie. I saw this movie with my friend when we were about 10. It's been bugging me for years! The Movie: Italian or Spanish I think, although I'm not certain. A group of friends go up to to a cabin or a house in the woods where they are drinking and partying. They have this one friend they don't really like and decide to ""prank"" him by throwing him in the pond but then he accidentally drowns. They go back into the house and in their panic they cause a fire and have to leave. Cut to a bit later and the main guy starts seeing the friend that they drowned everywhere and is getting freaked out. Then the friends start dying one by one - I think one of the girls is chased by dogs? And it looks like she's going to get away but then she gets trapped behind a gate? Anyway, the main guy and the love interest are all that's left and they figure out it's their dead friend's ghost or something killing all their friends and they try to get away and they're on the train when everything starts going dark and their dead friend shows up and is all (SPOILERS if my stellar description has made you desperate to watch this movie) ""I haven't been killing you, you are dying in that fire you started and this is all happening in your head during those last moments haha lol also you shouldn't drown people."" Like I said, I saw this movie 14 years ago so I'm kinda fuzzy on the rest, and I haven't been able to find anything about it (searched through all of imdb's ""drowning"" tag and ""fire"" tag and there's no ""dead all along"" tag, so I am at a loss. Also Googled as much as I could remember.) I watched it around 2000/2001, but it wasn't a new release so it's probably from the late 90s, maybe as far back as the late 80s? Anyway, so this has been bothering me for years, if anyone knows this movie I will love you forever.

The following description is very physical and fragmented, I can't tell you the meaning of the film as I fell asleep not because it was *beep* I remember years ago watching this film where it started off where a strange man was hitch hiking in a desert-y like atmosphere, as the film went on you start to realise that he's completely psycho and is encapsulated child like crying like a baby, though I think it was something to do with a young girl (very attractive) who was sexually frustrated and began to imagine this character although he appears to be real in the film before the scene draws to meeting her, I also remember a truck driver having a tattoo saying mother,probably incest desire, I only saw part of the film, and I've been searching and searching there's nothing I can find on the internet I've searched thoroughly, I think it was circa late 80's, it came on at like 2am I was asleep, but it wasn't a dream! there's a model train involved, a swimming pool involved I hope someone can help me with this and my funny description.

He hears the dog crying in the hole so he gets help from town. One of the men, maybe his dad, I lowered into the hole to get the dog and when they pull him up he is catatonic and his hair turned white. I don't think they revealed anything about the hole.

228403198	movie	extra	imdb	Australian movie about an American backpacker who goes orange picking?. Hi I've been looking for this movie for a while (went trough all Australian Movies by years in Wikipedia :D) but with no luck. I think it's the late 2000's, I remember the main character was an American woman who went to work in an orange farm for the summer. The owner had lost his wife in an accident- a tree fell on her car during a storm. The owner and the American had a love affair but it didn't work out so she left. At the end of the film he came to America so they could reconcile. If anyone remembers the title I would be so grateful!
228411526	movie	extra	imdb	Well-known old b+w noir film, but I can only recall the ending (SOLVED). The film is ""Blast of Silence"" (1961) http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0054687/?ref_=fn_al_tt_1 This is definitely a classic, but I just can't remember anything other than the final scene. I'm sure I watched it on Turner Classic Movies, perhaps a couple of years ago. As I mentioned, it's b&w, likely from the 40's or early 50's, and the ending takes place around dusk in a very flat marshy area with lots of wooden planks laid over the deep mud. The rest is a bit sketchy, so some of the details may be a little off. The main character (who may be a good guy or a criminal) goes there to meet some other shady characters (maybe to pick up some money), but he gets killed instead. I think he was stabbed...not sure though...could have been shot. I clearly remember him slowly dropping, his body laying half on a plank and half in the mud. His wife (or girlfriend), who has accompanied (or followed) the main character to the marsh, witnesses the murder. That's where the film ends. It's driving me nuts that I can't think of the title. Another note about the main character...he was one of those guys who was either bad at the beginning but turned good as the story unfolded, or vice versa (good guy who goes slightly bad). Either way, whether he deserved it or not, his death at the end was rather sad.
228413433	movie	extra	imdb	sci-fi set 'In the recent future' SOLVED by Doeeyes63. I seem to remember once seeing a science fiction movie that opened with the droll title card, ""In the recent future."" EDIT: Some may be having trouble understanding this particular wording. There is no ""recent future,"" only the past can be recent. So if I'm remembering correctly, this was an unusual, poetic use, to emphasize the sense of warning or prophecy of the film. For a long time I thought it was Gattaca, but it isn't. It's possible I imagined/dreamed it, but if not -- what was it? Last watched: In the Valley of Elah (3.5 of 4)

228486759	movie	extra	imdb	This has been driving me NUTS!! Hope one of you can help :) - SOLVED :D. This movie was done somewhere between 1980-82 and I could have sworn it starred Victoria Tennant as the main antagonist but I guess I was wrong because when I tried the search I couldn't find this anywhere! I've tried via plot search, on different ""name that movie title"" sites and I've had no luck whatsoever! Of course I tried here first and couldn't find a thing so I'm hoping someone here can help. Synopsis to best of my memory: A group of people decide to go to a weekend self improvement clinic to break their bad habits, i.e., smoking, weight gain, etc.. It turns out the purveyors of the treatments at this clinic are sadistic monsters who use humiliation, torture, and I think even threat of death to clients family members as incentive for cessation. There's no escaping the clinic until or unless a client is cured of their 'affliction'. I know that Stephen King did a 'short' regarding something similar, and I'm not confusing his story with this. This is an entirely separate movie that I remember seeing in a theatre in San Antonio back in summer 82. I thought Victoria Tennant was the main actress playing the villain who owned and ran the clinic but maybe it was someone who resembled her. Whoever it was, maybe I'm confusing her because she was reminiscent of Tennant's portrayals in Handmaid's Tale and Flower's in the Attic. Whoever she was, she could be Tennant's twin. Anyway, I hope someone can help me out. I'd like to see this movie again and discuss with my husband who's never seen it. I think it would make a good remake too, with the right director and cast. ............................................................. New favorite show; ORPHAN BLACK
228495656	movie	extra	imdb	short feature from 1968 or 1969 SOLVED!! (Boy, that was fast!). I went to see Rosemary's Baby in 1968 or 1969. Before the feature, there was a short subject film. The short had some classical music playing, and ballet dancers. The difference with this short was that the motion on the screen was a combination of regular movement and stop-action stills. If a dancer ran across the screen and jumped in the middle of the pass, the run-up to the jump might have been in regular movement -- one person moving across the screen. When the dancer jumped, the image changed into a cascade of still captures of the dancer as the jump was executed, with the stills remaining on the screen so there might be 30 or 40 images of the dancer during the jump. These might then be left on the screen as the dancer landed and continued the pass, or collapsed to the dancer as the pass was completed. As I remember it, the ""scenes"" included one or two dancers, male and female, in regular ballet costumes (tights, leotards, tutus), and the filming was against a black or dark background, and the dance costumes were either white or light. Can anyone tell me the name of the short, the music, the dance company, and most importantly, is this short available anywhere? It was a wonderful film, and one that I still remember 44 or 45 years later. S Moore

Somehow it helped me with the depression, so I've been looking for it since then. Don't recall the plot exactly. The genre is probably a comedy-drama. Protagonist is a rich man, who is struggling with the insomnia and depression. When at night he is feeling lonely he calls his accountant. Accountant is quite old family man and he is getting irritated, but can't refuse his boss requests. So they are sitting late at night and going through the papers.

Protagonist meets woman, who might cure his melancholia, but she gets the call from anonymous too. Near the end of the movie it's revealed that the caller is the protagonist himself. Depressed protagonist commits suicide. At the end of the movie he is pictured steering his private plane. During the closing credits he is shown skiing with his psychologist in the mountains. The movie seemed to be made in 80's, but I'm not sure about that. Through these years I've spent hours googling, so I'd really appreciate if you could help.

228548811	movie	extra	imdb	Been looking for this movie for YEARS... Help?. Hello, you guys. In the most recent days, I've become obsessed with finding a movie I started watching on HBO in, say 2008, which I didn't finish that time and never managed to find again. I've looked for it more than one time on the internet throughout the years, but ended up resigning on this ""quest"" since I wasn't able for the sake of me to find it. I hope, in my last attempt, that maybe one of you will help me find it. So here's the plot, from what I can remember: This couple, I presume on honeymoon, goes to this island - I think it was one of the Hawaii islands but not sure, it's something like that anyway - and they are normally enjoying their stay. However, as they hang around little markets in the island, they start to notice some strange people, like creepy locals that own these shops with ""magic"" or ""voodoo"" stuff (I realize that might not be accurate but I can't find any better words for it). And soon enough, one in the couple wakes up one day and the other is not there anymore. As they look for them, it seems like they might have never been on the island. That's all I remember, and frankly it might have some wrong parts. I realize it's not much to go on, but I REALLY hope you can help me. It's killing me and will keep on tormenting me until I forget it. And even if I forget it, it will come back to haunt me later on, like it has done now haha. Cheers. I love you. (Just a side note, the movie is not 'A Perfect Getaway' or 'Turistas'. I've checked.)

228566445	movie	extra	imdb	Solved - Movie title - knight in black armor beheaded - Les visiteurs. This is a topic I came across on this board years ago. I remember a great number of people trying to find the answer. Many of us remembered seeing this scene, but couldn't remember which movie it actually was. I don't think anyone came up with the answer, so I thought ""why not try again?""... I saw this film in Belgium when I was younger - let's say early '90s, but it could very well be older. I have no general memories about the movie, except that it COULD be a comedy (very possible i'm mistaken though). The scene I remember goes as follows: There's this knight in black armor. I do think he's ""the bad guy"". Someone tries to behead him (i think the hero). Instead of falling to the ground, his head sort of comes out of his armor (slowly). He's laughing (in a sinister manner) and I believe he had rather long grayish hair. So it seems he wasn't beheaded - he just had his helmet knocked off. I'm not sure about what happens next, but I think the hero just hacks off the real head as well. (could be I'm making this up though). Anyone have any idea?

228577807	movie	extra	imdb	Horror movie title? Set on a jungle island, probably made for tv. I remember watching a really bad TV quality movie on Channel 5 (UK) about 10 or so years ago in which a guy who kind of looked like Jeff Goldblum (I think) was on this jungle island that maybe had a mountain as part of some sort of research team or something? The one scene I remember is he's in the forest in, i think , a hammock trying to sleep and a witch or shaman or something disguised in some way tricks him into sex or something and he freaks out? I think it had a really terrible name like ""Monster Island"" but it isn't the Carmen Electra thing from 2004 sorry for the scant details, this has been bugging me forever thanks
228577812	movie	extra	imdb	Please help me, I need to find a movie.

228581875	movie	extra	imdb	**SOLVED** Need help with a B+W movie where a little boy drowns. I'm trying to remember what this movie is. It's in B&W, no earlier than the 50's. All I remember is, a woman is in a rowboat on a lake, and a kid is swimming along. I think he's her stepson or brother or something. Maybe she's just his teacher? Anyway, the kid starts to drown because he says a ""crab has his foot."" He reaches out for help, but the lady lets him drown. Later on, the woman is making excuses about his drowning to some guy, but the guy knows which end is up and accuses the woman of letting the boy drown.

228593892	movie	extra	imdb	SOLVED! (Brake (2012)). Hello everyone, This is my first time posting here, so pardon me if this has been asked before or if I am doing this wrong. I need help finding the name of a movie or TV series. I don't remember exactly which one it was. I saw a youtube video the other day that involved the movie Buried with Ryan Reynolds and it somewhat reminded me of it. Ok, here is what I remember: It involves a man who has been kidnapped and locked in a chest in the back of a truck. The driver randomly opens a little hole and either tases him or I believe releases bees inside. They give him a cell phone and they want some information from him. They had supposedly kidnapped his wife and was using her as leverage. They wanted access codes or a location. He is finally ""rescued"" after enough torture and it was all supposedly a training exercise with everything being faked, and his wife being in on it. They put him in an ambulance and he actually tells his wife that the code had something to do with her. Then she smiles and leaves the ambulance, and he finds out it wasn't fake. The end. Now, I am not fully sure of whether all of those facts are correct, as they might be from another TV episode or movie. Here are a couple of events that I think also happened in the episode or movie: - I think it was a terrorist attack that was launched and they kidnapped important people, the guy being one of them. -There were supposedly some explosions all over the city, as they were under attack. - He was able to talk to a couple other people on the cell phone while captured, maybe another agent that was also in on it with the wife and bad guys. -Most of the episode/movie is spent with the guy locked inside this chest, which I believe was clear and had a tube that led to the driver (Which is how he was zapped and the bees or whatever were put inside with him). And thats all I remember. I had about 1.5 TB of an external HD filled with movies and TV series, but it ended up taking a crap a couple years ago. I am working on rebuilding my collection once again, but this one, whether it is a TV episode or movie, seems to elude me. Any help would be greatly appreciated!! Thanks in advance!!

228631667	movie	extra	imdb	1970's made for TV movie. Ok so this is a 70's movie I believe. It takes place in an out of the way rural type farmland maybe? Think it was supposed to be a vacation or a honeymoon for this couple. All the people act really oddly. I remember a woman being in early pregnancy but people lay her down and put this wooden crate wall or something on her and they take turns putting heavy rocks on it while it's on her. And they do this until she says she will give up her husband so he can be with this girl. I think this group is part of a coven of sorts but oddly the husband is oblivious (at least I think he is but I think in the end it's revealed that he knew all along) to all they are doing to make this woman leave him. Weird I know but I have to know this movie. Pretty scary campy Help I'm dying to know what this movie was called!

228683511	movie	extra	imdb	Can anybody tell me what movie this sample is from? - SOLVED. I've been looking for a movie for years and all I have to go by is the sample from this intro song from a JMT album. When I search the words I never found anything yet I have always been very interested to find out what it is from. Here is the sample: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Bpk1nUVrJyE&list=RDBpk1nUVrJyE#t=17 The sample reads: When I had opened the fifth seal I saw the souls of those who had been slaughtered for the Word of God. ""Holy And True, how long will it be before you judge and avenge our blood on the inhabitants of the Earth?"" It was the darkest hour of the long, dark night of the sun. The chills (settled?) with divine callousness. What twisted fairy tale had I allowed myself to be entangled up into. (In?) this place of gravity that i believed to be (warm?).

228685905	movie	extra	imdb	60s/70s scary movie? So-called 'haunted' box? SOLVED. Trying to find the name of this movie! All I have to go on is one scene. A group of people are sitting around a table. A man shows them a small wooden box which he says is haunted and that everyone who has ever dared to open it....died a horrible death. So he passes it around the table but no one dares open it. The box then is passed back to the man where he immediately opens it, and pulls up a cigar which he then lights and smokes. He informs the group that he made up the story about the box to show them how easily fear of something can rob you of thinking rationally and to be sure to not to be fooled again. The group might have been preparing to go and investigate a so called haunted house so the main man wanted to ""teach"" them something about not letting their fear clould their judgement. The movie was probably from the 60s or 70s....might have been a British film ( Hammer?) Does anyone know this movie?
228688994	movie	extra	imdb	(Unsolved) Two 80s horror movies that aren't your first guess. I have been looking for these two movies for the last 10 years or so, but no one seems to be able to identify them, though people find they have vague memories of them as well. In the first movie, there's a ""haunted"" house. In the end the house implodes/folds in on itself and disappears in bright flashes of pale blue light. The house is deemed evil and alive, possibly from another dimension, and it alone is responsible for the mishaps in the movie, not some kind of entity haunting the house. The house might have been eating people. In the second movie, a family gets stranded in an old mining town and is stalked by freaks/things living beneath the earth. There's a car cemetery in the vicinity of the town implying previous victims. In the end, it's nighttime, the family is safe in a nearby regular town and is saying goodbye to the local sheriff. There's an ending scare while the family is driving away, implying that the sheriff is a freak himself and is in on it, as well as the whole ""regular"" town possibly - The regular town's lights turn off and it drifts into darkness as the family drives away. The movies are not ""Poltergeist"" and ""The Hills Have eyes."" They are from the 80s, possibly early 90s, are US made, and both looked like they were made on decent to large budgets. Edit: The second movie has been identified as Disappearance (2002), thanks to MadSimian.

228720921	movie	extra	imdb	Comedy Movie Question. Okay it's a movie made in the 1980s (I believe) and I wanna say it stars Steve Guttenberg (or Michael Keaton or Bobcat Goldwaith) but that's just my faulty memory and I looked in all of their filmologies and nothing came up that resembled the movie. It's about some hospital. It's a comedy from what I recall. The only scene I remember distinctly is that a nurse who looks plain and unflattering is trying to look sexy and she is applying make-up to look like Brooke Shields. She even has a picture/magazine or something to go off of. So she dolls herself up and people on the medical staff notice her. She's even wearing heels and making her uniform look jazzed up. Later in the movie, she goes back to her usual looks. What is this movie?

228756816	movie	extra	imdb	Old Western Movie? SOLVED. My mom was talking about a movie from her childhood that she saw on TV around 1960. She couldn't remember the title but thinks it was a western style B movie. She doesn't know any actors in the movie or any character names but did have this brief description of the plot. There is a stagecoach that is traveling and breaks down/gets robbed/stopped, possibly in a desert like area. For some reason, a woman on the stagecoach dies and the other passengers on the stagecoach decide that leaving her infant child to die is the best option for the group to survive. A man on the stagecoach with a checkered past decides that is not okay and he takes the baby to try to find help on his own. In an important scene, the man is very dehydrated and comes across a source of water. The man sees a dead animal near the water and somehow knows the water is tainted and unsafe but he decides to drink the water so he can continue to find help for the baby. In the final scene, the man is able to make it to help and hands the baby off and dies shortly thereafter presumably because of the tainted water he drank. Thanks in advance to anyone who tries to help figure this out.
228761867	movie	extra	imdb	Time travel love story from the '80s - colonial America (?) SOLVED. I'm trying to figure out the name of a movie I saw as a young child in the early '80s or possibly late '70s: I believe I saw it in the theater which would make the release date in that time frame. In one of the early scenes, there is a young woman in colonial America who is wracked with fever. This is juxtaposed with a boy (also sick?) in the present day. I don't remember too many of the details, but somehow a connection through time is formed between the two. For instance, the woman in her feverish state asks for a Coke, which is what the boy is also requesting in the present time. Fast forward through most of the movie, in the climactic scene, after the connection through time has been broken, the man discovers a carving (initials?) in a log in the woods that proves that the connection was real and not simply a dream (?). Can anyone help me? It's been bugging me for a long time!

I also remember a good looking guy with a cowboy hat, I think he came to the house in the first episode, and the eldest girl had a crush on him (of course...). The title might have been something like Noah's Paradise or Noah's Garden or something else with garden or paradise in it... Of course it might not, since I get nowhere with that here on imdb...

He spoke with a British or pretentious American accent. It was called ""The [BLANK]"". Anyone? George Carlin: It's all bullsh-t and it's bad for ya.

228819945	movie	extra	imdb	Help with a tv show. Hi all, I need help remembering the name of a tv show. It was american. It was a show where they would recreate a murder case and they had two teams who would work against each other and try and figure out who the killer was. The cases were based on true murder cases. The would recreate the entire scene and would give them the information of some suspects. The teams got to decide who they wanted to question and if they chose to question a suspect you would see real footage from the interrogations. The teams had to decide what questions to ask and were only showed the footage relating to those questions. At the end they had to put together their brief and say who they thought the killer was and why. I hope this is enough information for someone to remember the show. I loved it and it's sending me insane not being able to remember the name. Thanks :)

It's a British film, probably 1970s-80s. Set in London, I think. Main actor #1 is working class and wants to move up in life. He meets the well-bred actor #2 and they end up sharing a house. Here's a bit of dialogue from memory: - you've got something I want. (actor #1) - what's that? - Class. - Oh you mean that savoir-wotsit Actor 2 might have been in trouble (for fraud?) at some point in the past. There's another bit of dialogue with him saying 'one day a cloud drifted in and I walked out underneath it' and clarifying what happened as fraud. Actor 1 kills people off, including his landlady, towards the end and moves away.

228851797	movie	extra	imdb	TV Episode about fooling a lie detector. Hello all, I have been trying to remember which TV detective/cop show this episode is from. I want to say I would have seen it sometime in the last 15 years (so no earlier than 2000 or so). I watch a lot of shows (CSI, NCIS, Criminal Minds, etc) so it could have been any of those or even a few others. Here is what I remember: There is a male and female detective and they are sure they have the correct suspect for the murder of a woman but when they have the guy come in and take a lie detector test he passes it no problem and they have no other evidence that nails the guy so they have to let him go. I think the guy killed his wife (or possibly girlfriend). The detectives go back to question the guy later and he is running on a treadmill that has a fancy little thing to track his heart-rate, etc. The male detective later remembers this and figures out the suspect used the treadmill to ""control"" his heart rate (by practicing on it while running) so he could beat the lie detector. I want to say in the end they use this knowledge to get the guy to confess. Does this sound familiar to anyone? Any help is appreciated. I tried looking through the episode list(s) for the shows I watch regularly but it is a looooonnnnggg list. Lol. Thanks in advance.

It might have been dutch, but also maybe Belgian.

They accidentally bump heads, and she falls down the stairs and dies. As he tries to pull her back upstairs, he accidentally pulls off her panties and puts them in his mouth for some reason, just at the time as someone opens the front door and sees him there with the naked neighbor and the panties in his mouth.

228899546	movie	extra	imdb	[SOLVED] Comedy/dramedy about a teenage girl running away. Basically, there's this sardonic teenage girl who, right in the middle of a somewhat crazy and overall unfriendly family reunion, decides that she's had enough and runs away. The focus of the movie is the girl and her adventures on the road, but it also keeps cutting back to the family, showing everyone to bond with each other as they search for her. One thing I vividly remember is the girl getting picked up by a very nice family . They see through her lies and try to tell her that she should go back and give her family a second chance, but the girl ultimately decides to run away from them as well, albeit guiltily so. Throughout the movie, the girl keeps narrating by talking directly into the camera. I'm pretty sure it was a 90's movie, early-mid 90's.

I remember that the woman from the future wore high heels that looked made of gold or another metal with curlicues on the instep. She also had some kind of sequined/sparkly tights under the nurses uniform. Eventually the time travel machine blows up after this creature has killed several people. I really wish that there was a channel that would play all of the '50's B level sci fi. That would be a kick!

228909937	movie	extra	imdb	Anyone remember this movie:. I need a film title I saw waaaay back in the early 1980s on one of the cable channels-HBO, Showtime etc. I think it was one of those nasty Cannon films or maybe a Golan/Globus production: The plot of the film involved a teenage girl who thinks her mother's new husband is not only two timing her but also planning on knocking her off...but it turns out He and his scumbag mistress are, in fact trying to do just that. They accidentally run over the protagonists gal pal thinking it's her(naturally this is a bad thing except that the protagonist inherits the dead girl's hunky boyfriend). The dirtbags kidnap the girl & the mother & hold them hostage. They escape when the girl wires the doorknob to an electrical cord & fries the scumbag mistress. I forgot what happened next but the husband is presumed dead (an explosion or something?) & does one of those last minute 'return from the dead' & threatens the heroine of the movie, only to be killed conclusively again. There is violence & nudity in the movie too. Does this ring any bells with anybody? Bear in mind, I don't recall any of the actors names & there were definitely no major or minor ""stars"" on it. Thanks ahead of time. Why can't you wretched prey creatures understand that the Universe doesn't owe you anything!?

228957987	movie	extra	imdb	80's TV movie about old man versus street gang (SOLVED). SOLVED: The answer is Night of Courage (1987). Thanks to a_l_i_e_n. I saw a TV movie in 1985 about a street gang that terrorizes a neighborhood. One of the main characters was an old white man who lived in a house, NOT an apartment building. The neighborhood was NOT the type with tall run-down apartment buildings that is usually seen in these type of movies. The street gang looked like the sterotypical street gang you only see in 80's movies: bandanas, denim cut off jackets, multi-ethnic. I distinctly remember a scene where the gang chases a teenager. He had no shoes on - I assume the gang took them - and he had to run over broken glass in the street to get away from them. I think they might have caught him and hurt him really bad or he might have gotten hit by a car. In the final scene, the neighbors manage to run the gang out of the neighborhood. I don't remember exactly how they did it. But the final scene is the old man yelling out his window something ""Yeah, get outta here!"" or ""We got ya!"" or words to that effect. The closing credits were over a freeze frame of the man's house. The gang was not arrested they just ran away. I remember my father telling me ""They could just come back anyway"". I'm pretty sure it was a TV movie because I saw it prime time on a network. I think it was ABC but not positive. It's possible that it was an unsold pilot or an episode of an anthology series. I know it's not much to go on and maybe something will jog my memory. Closest possibility: Boardwalk (1979) Definitely not: Defiance (1980) Siege (1978) Death Wish 3 (1985) Outrage (1973) We're Fighting Back (1981) George Carlin: It's all bullsh-t and it's bad for ya.

It's a film released in the last five years with known lead actors one male, one female, neither of which we can remember.

228979640	movie	extra	imdb	Horror film fans - need help on an old movie.. Morning!! Right, when i was around 8/9 (around 26yrs ago) i watched a movie which i think but, not sure starred Michael Caine. This film would probably be from around 1975-1980 ish i imagine. There's a good chance it was a hammer horror - but there are millions of them and i watched so many as a kid. But my only scene i can go from is:- Michael (i think) is standing at the top of a basement staircase and in the (i think) chest freezer is a chopped up body of a woman (i think its a woman). Her limbs and head were wrapped up in paper and the body, in all its parts managed to somehow (as only they do in horror films) climb up the stairs. The head can be seen breathing and sucking in the paper as it took breaths - if you get me. He was looking at the wrapped up head with terror on his face. Thats it. Thats all i got!!!! If anyone out there could point me in the right direction i would be eternally grateful as i need to know how crappy the film was that had a wrapped up, breathing, human head THAT COULD CLIMB STAIRS which haunted my dreams.. until i saw the shining a few months later. Thank you to all!! xx
228993335	movie	extra	imdb	[SOLVED] 80s(?) film with a rich senile elderly man and a pantry closet. I have a vague memory of a movie I saw in the 80s (or maybe early 90s) that had an elderly man who was senile or just forgetful and was very rich. His role was just a supporting character. The movie was a comedy, I believe. It may have featured Eddie Murphy or some other comedic black actor. The elderly man lived in a large home, and in one scene they showed an open pantry closet (or a room) that had lots of foodstuffs stored on the shelves. All I remember is seeing lots of Oreo cookie packages on the shelves -- as a kid that's what caught my attention. I think the elderly man was somebody's rich uncle, but I don't remember.

229086392	movie	extra	imdb	Two titles needed. (SOLVED) The first one is a teen film from the 1980's. I remember it being fairly unremarkable besides for the ending. It was one of those rare times where the lead character didn't get the girl he was pursuing. Not in a 'Some Kind of Wonderful' way, but in a not usual from Hollywood kind of way. (Last American Virgin) I believe the second one is told from the perspective of a little boy and it starts with his father yelling in the hospital after the birth. Basically he thinks the baby is too ugly to be his. A few years later, while they are taking a picture, he gives the boy a gun and he fires it, which makes his dad proud. I think these scenes happened at the beginning of the movie; although it could have been the pilot of a show. I would say 90s or early 00s. That's all I remember. I have come here to chew bubblegum and kick ass... and I'm all out of bubblegum.
229087457	movie	extra	imdb	70's/80's children's show about Spanish. NOT Carrascolendas Villa Alegre Mundo Real Closest possibility: Sonrisas In the 80's in New York City, I remember watching a show similar to Sesame Street but the purpose was specifically to teach Spanish language and Latin American culture. It took place on a city street and the cast was Black and Latino. I remember one episode where one of the Black kids - he had a big fro - refused to try a Latin America soup or stew. For the whole episode the cast is trying to convince him to try something new. Finally, at the end they have a block party where he tries and he loves it. The focus was on Carribean Latin American culture (Puerto Rican, Cuban, Dominican), not Mexican. So it may have only aired in the NYC area or just on the East Coast. It may have been based out of New York or Miami. From what I recall, it wasn't a PBS show. It aired on Saturday morning. The theme song was a salsa or merengue type song. I vaguely remember the title beginning with an ""S"". but I'm not sure about that George Carlin: It's all bullsh-t and it's bad for ya.
229090249	movie	extra	imdb	90s Softcorish Drama, involving man tricked during sex. So for like 5 years I've been trying to remember what the name of this cheesy movie was from the mid to late 90s. (Had to be 90-2000) What I can remember: -There's a man who's in some kind of torrid romance with a woman -Low production values, probably a softcore film. -Halfway through the woman blindfolds the man with his dress tie, and they make love. -Partway through sex we find out that the woman switched and it's really her friend instead...and the guy realizes when the original woman bends down to whisper into his ear something like""It will be our turn soon..."" -Guy removes the tie, says something like ""Cammy/Dani! etc"" in exclamation at seeing it's the OTHER woman, and then she takes the tie from him, gags him with it and basically rides him to completion. ***-The only other thing I can remember about the movie is the specific song playing during that scene...which is Bahu-Rang's Strange Imagination (written/produced by Joseph Pusateri. (https://soundcloud.com/joseph-pusateri/strange-imagination) Any ideas???!

229124941	movie	extra	imdb	Looking for name of old action movie / spy comedy SOLVED. Hello everyone. I was hoping someone could help me find the name of an old film I saw when I was younger which I remember very little of. I am not sure if it was a spy comedy or just a straightforward action movie. The main character looks similar to Michael Cain as Harry Palmer (British with funky glasses) and it begins with an underwater scene with the camera panning through a region of either cars and junk or dead mobsters with cement shoes (I may be way off) and some comedic music. During this time, a narrator may or may not be talking. The only other scene I remember is a bomb diffusing scene in which the main character helps to save a girl by delaying a bomb that looks similar to a Googled image of John Harrison's H1 clock. He removes her from the room, and it blows up behind him as he is walking down the street. It appeared to have been from the late 60s to late 70s. I caught a snippet of it on tv the other day, but did not get a chance to record it and can't locate the info on the DVR guide. Can anyone help me?
229135386	movie	extra	imdb	Name of Movie please? I'm going nuts. SOLVED, Thank you. This is all I can remember. The bad guy marries a nice girl and he is only doing it to have a son (I think). She has a baby (they are very wealthy by the way) and this movie is over 25 years old. That much is certain. Everyone is dressed in period clothes (from a bygone era). The guy actually has a mistress who can't give him a child. and at the end of the movie, they are all in a courtroom. There is a good guy policeman on the case and he's in love with the bad guy's wife. At tne end of the movie they find out that the bad guy does indeed have a mistress (who is blond and is sitting right next to him in court). For whatever reason, a german ship captain is holding the boy on his big ship. They rescue the young boy and at the end of the movie, the wife and the young boy wind up with the good guy policeman (at least it seemed that way). If anyone remembers this movie or mini series or whatever it was, please let me know. Thanks.

229145223	movie	extra	imdb	Need help with a movie title?. About a year ago, my school showed us a video just to keep us quiet during a teacher meeting. At first, I didn't pay much attention to it because it was pretty boring at first, but as the movie progressed it became much more interesting. I wish I would've gotten the title from the school, but I forgot about it. This is what I remember about it. The beginning scene shows this SWAT team break through a door, then the scene flashes to this old guy watching tv in a dark room of this live performance of a ballet (I think) and then switches to a concert of an orchestra. This prisoner of some sort then takes over the stage and threatens to blow up the auditorium or whatever the concert was in. He has a remote in his hand and is chained up pretty securely. The orchestra stops playing and he asks one of the cello players to play him a song. This is all I can remember about it. I'm not sure if this is from a movie, tv show, experimental film or whatever. If any of you know the answer; however, please let me know ASAP. Thanks!

229151138	movie	extra	imdb	Name of Movie [SOLVED]. So I can't figure out the name of a movie. All I remember is that it was an older movie and I somewhat remember the plot. The movie is about a director who is getting older so his work isn't as good as it used to be. The people funding his projects won't lend him any money because his ideas are bad or have been done before. He has his own writer who writes for him, but is getting older too and wants to retire. The directors secretary is in love with the director and always has been. One day the director tells the secretary to gather her things and leave the office because he has given up. As the secretary leaves, she turns around and shares how she feels about the director. The director then tells the secretary to repeat what she said to him because it was genius. The director is totally oblivious to what the secretary said to him, but takes the words she said and runs to the writer and turns it into a script. The people who are funding the idea love it. He then tries to find actors and actresses to play the two lead parts. During a rehearsal, the secretary repeats the same words that she said before to the director, but other than the actress, the secretary's acting is more genuine and believable because she is actually in love. So they can the main actress and us the secretary instead. That is all I remember. If anyone knows what movie this is that would be awesome!

First off, I know it isn't Sleepaway camp (1983) - just watched that the other night. Nor is it Camp Slaughter or any of the Friday The 13th films. Don't remember too much about the film except it takes place at a summer camp, one of the ones where kids stayed for weeks, not just a weekend thing. One of the murders happened in the camp director's office - someone in charge - there was a locker/cabinet full of red rubber dodge balls, want to say the person in the room was killed with lawn dart looking things, and was either dead nailed to the inside of the cabinet or the room door maybe. At some point there were bodies hanging up in the trees. Kinda want to say that the killer was one of the camp employees, like a teen/younger adult working as one of the councilors/cabin councilors and it turns out he'd been at the camp as a kid and bullied so much he went psycho. May be mixing that part up with another movie. ANy ideas??? Bobby: ""You don't shoot Bambi, jacka$$. You shoot Bambi's mother.""

I think she was giving her daughter or granddaughter a lecture about the evils of sexuality. But then we see that Grandma still has human urges. I don't dare do a Google search for this. The scene wasn't meant to be funny or purient. It was to make you feel sorry for her self-imposed loneliness. George Carlin: It's all bullsh-t and it's bad for ya.

Its an old film, maybe from the 60'... or 70' and it could be an english movie, but Im not sure anymore, the story take place in a boarding school, the main characters are a bullied student, lame on one leg and one teacher (he is also a priest, so it must be a catholic boarding school, when I think of this priest, I have to think of Christopher Plummer, but I don't know for sure if he played the priest). The film is a thriller, there is a lot of tension because of this student, and at some point, the priest tried to protect him. At the end it turns out that the bullied student is actually a kind of psychopath and the priest kill him after some revelations the student made him in the forest.

I seem to recall that it was either a Western or a 20's/30's gangster film and I had thought the star was Richard Gere (and it may well be) but I've looked at his filmography and can't identify it. I thought it was perhaps 'No mercy' with Kim Basinger from about 1986, but I found a copy and it's not that film. It's too modern. The film I am puzzling over is definitely set before WW2, maybe Western times However, what I remember is a final shootout scene in a highly polished wooden hotel reception area and the baddie had a shotgun - the goodie was running up some polished wooden stairs and the baddie was shooting put the stairs from underneath as goodie ran up them (or vice versa!) I think the hotel burns down in the end. I don't remember if there was female interest , but my mind nags me that there was - it's been a long time ago! I think I probably saw the movie in about the 90's. but I could be wrong. I'm wondering if it wasn't the remake of 'The Getaway', but I'm pretty sure it wasn't - it sticks in my mind that it was either a Western or early 20th century gangster movie Any help in identifying the movie from such a small amount of information would be much appreciated ;-)

229347273	movie	extra	imdb	4 teenage girls and a dead body?(solved). Saw part of a Canadian movie last night that I never caught the name for. I don't know what happened to the guy but it looks like he died in some kind of accident. The 4 teenage girls were lost without him and trying to find their way out but had decided to bring the body with them. They started with canoes but eventually ended up with 3 of the girls walking off by themselves and one staying behind to keep guard over the body. In the end she finally buried him and tried getting out on her own. I had to keep the volume down because of a sleepy wife so I missed a lot of the commentary that the girl was thinking.
229375951	movie	extra	imdb	Indie Film I Watched On Netflix. A few years ago I watched this indie film on netflix but i can't remember the name.

229378516	movie	extra	imdb	Anyone recognize this video cover?. I remember there was a video cover to a movie I remember in my video store back when video stores were still around and I'm trying to know what movie this was. The movie looked like it was from either the 80s or mid 90s. Definitely not any later. Likely from the 90s since it has the 90s style video cover in the way it's framed, coloured and shadowed (think Point of No Return). It looked like a spy movie. I remember a male and a female were on the cover in one corner. Pretty certain they were well dressed. There was another well dressed woman that takes up more than half of the box cover. You don't see her head though, but you see she's wearing a sultry dress, stockings, long gloves, she's sticking out her leg and has a small revolver in her hand. Anyone remembers a movie with a video cover like this? Trying to ID this movie. RIP AJ Cook's career. Her career dies everytime she's on the sh#t known as Criminal Minds.

229389517	movie	extra	imdb	Movie identification help (murder/kidnapping scene). When I was pretty young (I want to say 7-10, but I don't really remember), I was at a friend's house and we ended up watching a movie that I'm guessing we found by channel surfing (because I'm sure our parents were unaware of it). I basically remember nothing about it but one scene, which had me paranoid for years. I'm guessing it probably wasn't quite as graphic and terrifying as I remember it being, but I've periodically tried to track down the movie since then to figure out what the movie actually was but haven't had too much success. Basically what I remember (however accurate said memory might be) of it is a scene where a couple invites someone into their house. I think they know him, but don't really know. They end up standing in the kitchen and the wife turns around and goes to get the guest coffee or water or something, when he shoots her in the back. Then he turns and shoots the husband. At that point, somewhere else in the house, their kid (I think it was a boy) goes and hides in a closet, where I think the murderer finds him and kidnaps him? Honestly, I'm not sure about the last part, because I'm pretty sure that 7-10 year old me was mostly hiding under blankets at that point, so I'm not sure how much I actually remember and how much my brain has just filled in. Does any of that ring any bells for anyone?

229430901	movie	extra	imdb	Early 2000s sci-fi TV movie (Solved). I've very vague memories of this. It was about a male and a female scientist, who may or may not have been lovers, working on a revolutionary new technology and she was turned into a sort of living computer code life form. (Yeah, I know it doesn't sound great. I didn't think that it was then either! I don't think that I finished watching it.) I think that the female scientist had either red or brown shoulder length hair. I was convinced that Michael Weatherly was the male scientist but nothing that he did seems to match up with it. It was on British TV, probably Sky One, in late 2003 - I remember that specifically because of what I was doing at the time - so it must have on American TV before that, though Sky did usually get the latter half of seasons of ""Stargate"" and other shows before the US did. Anyone have any ideas?

A girl in this class is the last one standing (again, I think) and getting beaten by this mysterious man, she's laying on ice while people are skating on it, she screams at them for help but no one notices her, the man comes forward, then I think everyone in class wake up and they all think it was a dream. Sorry for this bad explanation but yeah, if anyone knows the title of the movie I would be very pleased, as I haven't found it. :) EDIT: The man is wearing a parka with a hood over his face the whole time I think, if that helps x) RE EDIT: Got my answer, thank you very much :)

A freak boy uses to hang himself in his room just to surprise his family that he is kidding. His family got used to his games as well as to his eccentricity and withdrawal. In the course of the movie, the boy gets to know an older homeless-like woman who is not less bizarre. The woman could readily enter a shop to steel money or shoplift...and could go out to drive away in any available car to escape in a very clumsy way. As a non skilled driver, the woman may hit a parking car while making a turn or may hit an other parking car while driving in a hardly straight path. The boy said in an occasion' I miss suicide'. The boy and the woman developed a kind of close relation as they find many things in common. The boy eventually asked the woman to be his wife. Some one in the movie criticized 'how could you marry an old lady with sagging breasts'. I wish someone could recall the name of that movie. Thanks.

229460270	movie	extra	imdb	SOLVED**** Woman/wife/girlfriend is turned into a child/teenage. OK, this is driving me nuts. There is a movie, or perhaps even an episode of a TV show(I am pretty sure its not animation) where a girl who is maybe 25-35 gets somehow turned young, like maybe 12-14yrs old. Its also a possibility that its a mind swap type of thing, but I don't think so. Alright, so here is what stands out, and the scene that is stuck in my head. The woman that's now a kid, in this movie/show, she has a boyfriend or husband, or even just a guy friend. Alright so the scene goes like this: The woman-girl pushes the guy onto a bed or couch, or he was already lying down, and tells the guy that they should ""do it"", cause she is horny and she isn't really a kid, and she tells him something like ""you know you are fantasizing about this"", or something. Of course the guy thinks for a sec and comes to his senses and pushed her away, I think the woman-girl gets mad/frustrated and walks off. I think the biggest part of it is that for some reason the condition may be permanent, so she is like ""what's the big deal, I'm not a kid"", and also says something like ""so I have to suffer because you cant 'do it' with a teen"" Its like a totally weird scene, and I remember watching thinking that its totally creepy, but the woman had a valid point, that what if she is stuck like that, they can't be 'together' until 5 more years or something, and she is a little older. Note: There is strange possibility that this is something I read in a novel, but I don't think so.

Here is all I remember about the movie. It was a fantasy movie. I think it had 2 parts, or the TV channel just split it on half, I don't know because it was the same story with ""to be continued"" on the end of the first part. The characters were one father with two children(two daughters or a daughter and son not sure). They lost their mother recently. The girl was good at painting I think. They were somehow taken to another fantasy world where they cruised on a ship and had multiple adventures on islands. I remember them going to some desert island with a labyrinth and some monster inside of it. Than I remember them going to a place where they meet Medusa and also beating her somehow. Than at the exit they get some kind of riddle and one of the girls gets it right. I think it was ""What walks on four legs in the morning, two in the afternoon and three at the evening"" but I am also not sure about it. So, this is all I remember. I think I didn't watch the second part of the movie, so all of this might be from the first part. Thank you :D

He gets interested in a girl and get invited to her birthday party, but at that party he gets his ass kicked by the girls boyfriend (or someone who also likes the girl).

229535238	movie	extra	imdb	Please help me identify this movie. It has had me stumped... (SOLVED). Way back in the 1960s -- I couldn't have been more that seven at the time -- I saw part of a violent crime film on TV that really disturbed me. It was in B&W and had elements of various genres: Gangster, Noir, Prison, Juvenile Delinquent. It was possibly made as early as the 30s or as late as the 50s (maybe even early 60s). Here are my hazy 48+ year old impressions: 1) The protagonist is telling his story in flashback through off-screen narration while you see him as a teenage delinquent in a dark, grimy urban setting. 2) He lives in a tenement apartment. His mother is bedridden and possibly has a trapeze like handle hanging above her bed with which she can raise herself up. 3) He and his gang buddies are joy riding in a car. At some point they are chased by police and the car catches on fire. inside the moving, burning car their is confusion and panic. 4) We next see the protagonist in prison -- or possibly reform school. He is in line to be served in the mess hall when he causes a disturbance. I vaguely remember him dumping a tray of beans (or something similar) back into one of the serving pots. 5) The guards drag him away kicking and screaming. They throw him into a solitary cell, slam shut the door and appear to shove a teargas canister inside the cell through an opening in the door. 6) The last thing I remember is seeing the protagonist writhing on the floor in agony coughing and choking as gas fills the cell -- This was the part that really got to me. I will be eternally grateful to whomever can attach a name to this.

I watched it around 1990/1991 on television I remember: - a girl and her (i think younger) brother, i think they were eskimo children, maybe about 10 years old - they're by themselves in an arctic/tundra setting (snow, some forrest), making their way home. - they have meat with them, which they try to bring home - they're chased for the meat by an aggressive wolverine - I think they give the meat to the wolverine so they're not in danger anymore; in that scene the wolverine growls at the children and it takes place at a desolate tree somewhere in the tundra Maybe I should add that I'm from Germany but I'm sure it wasn't a German movie! -It might have been from a TV-series, but I tend to think it was a movie -The movie was in color; I think it was made somewhere in the 80s. This is driving me nuts; feels like I read every article on wolverines in childrens movies google could give me - still I didn't find it, so I really hope someone on here might help!
229573093	movie	extra	imdb	SOLVED 'Show me your boobs' quote by little boy on a bus. I can't remember the name of the movie, or the actress that played in this movie, however, the scene I'm referring to, this actress gets on a bus and needs to use a phone and sees a little boy sitting playing with his phone. She asks him to use the phone and he replies, ""Show me your boobs"". I recall her smacking him in the back of the head and taking the phone. I was reminded of this scene after watching Walk Of Shame with Elizabeth Banks and a similar situation happened to her in that movie when she tried to steal/borrow a bike that belong to a little boy. Anyone know the name of the movie I'm referring to? It was a fairly new/recent movie. I was thinking it was the Veronica Mars movie. _ Every person that served can be called a veteran, but not every veteran can be called a Marine.

The Swedish star, pretty sure it was Ursula Andress (Tall, very sexy and statuesque) plays a young girl who is staying with a couple here in the US. The husband is some kind of professor or lecturer. Ursula (?) gets a crush on him and decides she is going to seduce him and have his baby and go back to Sweden with it. It was very 50s ...everyone smoked and all the women were dressed to the nines, in high heels and pears. It was perhaps a comedy. Thank you.

All I can remember is that she was really worried for him (on his mission). I think the plane was in trouble of crashing on landing (something went wrong with the landing-gear/wheels, I think) and unless corrected they'd crash and possibly die on landing. There were three or four on the plane and I'm not sure if he was or wasn't the pilot.""Italy invented the pizza, took it to New York...but Chicago perfected it."".
229583193	movie	extra	imdb	90's film of an American soldier who gets stranded in Japan. It's an action flick set in World War II where an American Air Force pilot crash lands into an island during the attack in Japan. The island was inhabited by a wealthy Japanese man who, instead of killing the soldier, decided to train him in the art of Kendo so he could fight without a disadvantage. The Japanese warrior spends the whole movie teaching his philosophy and killing techniques to the soldier, and in the end the two finally have a duel in which the American disappointingly ends up killing the Japanese with a gun. My Kendo Sensei recommended this movie to me, the title is supposedly ""Enemy Mine"" but I found no such title with that plot within the site. By the looks of it, it is kind of a WWII version of ""The Hunted"", starring Christopher Lambert, in which a foreigner miraculously learns the art of Kendo in a matter of months.
229588675	movie	extra	imdb	Made for TV vampire movie exist? Solved... Around the mid 70's to early 80's, I have vague memories of a ""vampire"" movie on television. I only remember two scenes and wonder if it ever existed. It starred a young woman. I recall the following. A woman is locked in a room with a chalice of blood. She is mentally tortured until she drinks from the chalice. The room brightens and she enjoys the sanity once she surrenders. In a ritual to prove her vampireness, she must bite the neck of a male victim lying on a stone slab. She is hesitant until another vampire nicks his neck with a razor. The sight of blood entices her. Did this film exist? If so what? How did it end? Seemed like a dark, depressing film.

229697470	movie	extra	imdb	What movie is this.... The movie opens with a shot of a semi driving into a bad-looking part of town. Various people are re-wiring the upcoming traffic light. They turn it red so the semi has to stop. While the semi is stopped, I think the people hook wires/cables to the trailer to cause it to detach once the truck begins moving again. The light turns green and the semi takes off and loses it trailer. This causes the driver to get out and check things and he gets attacked. He has a Texan accent and is dressed ""cowboy-like"" and I believe he utters something about the way the people are dressed. Again, I believe this is the opening of the movie. Definitely 80s, could have been one of those post-apocalyptic movies and MIGHT have had Jackie Chan. Thanks for the help!
229698688	movie	extra	imdb	[SOLVED] Help IDing an animated film. My little sister used to watch an animated film when she was young. We ended up talking about it the other day but neither of us could remember the title. I don't know the exact release date but it's probably in the late '90s. It was a typical (princess?) film for young girls. I don't think it was a Disney film though. I don't remember much about it except that there's a character (a bird or a frog I think) that said ""Nothing is impossible for Jackimo!"" and that at some point there's a wedding being interrupted, at the end/climax I guess. Sorry I don't have many informations but I hope some of you can still help me. Thank you!
229711906	movie	extra	imdb	Name of Horror Movie?. I remember once me, my brother and my cousins rented out this really bad horror movie and I can't remember what it's called.

There's another scene where the antagonist is an ally and gets run over by someone, or he rolls out of the way. It's not much to go on but maybe someone knows what I'm thinking of. We rented it out about 12 years ago, not sure when the actual movie was released but I would guess probably 90's or early 00's.

229717381	movie	extra	imdb	Movie Title wanted, plot described within. [Solved]. Thanks for clicking into my post. Query now SOLVED. Movie title: ""Awakenings"". --- --- I'm looking for the title of a pre-2012 movie please. It is not a horror and it is not Dallas Buyers Club. --- --- What I can remember are / the vague plot is as follows: It was set in a care / retirement home. The movie was about a medicine / drug trial to help dementia / Alzheimer's. One elderly's actions was to look out from a window. He / she did that every single day, from the same spot of the room, looking out the same window. At first, only 1 elderly within the care home was given this drug. The effects of the drug were soon very noticeable. His movements / actions / activities improved greatly. Then all of the elderly in the care home was given the drug. Everybody's actions & activities improved by a vast amount. Some were able to play chess, others were able to stand up and move about. The elderly who always looked out the window, now did other things too. But, after a while (weeks / months), the effects of the drug on the first trial patient (the first elderly who had the drug) wore off, and he / she went back to one's pre-trial state. Then after the same time-lag period, the rest of the care home elderly people's ""advancements & improvements"", which were brought around by the trial drug, wore off too. Everybody thus were back to their original state. The elderly who looked out the window from the same spot everyday, now looked out the same window again. --- --- Sincere thanks to you who clicked into and read this post. Thank you so much in advance, if you could help me by naming that movie.
229718747	movie	extra	imdb	SOLVED - Which film? A workshop falls apart. Hi, I've a memory of a film, possibly set in medieval times, where some people were hammering nails into something in a workshop, but had to reach across the room from where they were working to pick up each nail. Someone comes in to the workshop and says it would be easier for them if the nails were moved closer, so picks them up and moves them. At which point, the whole system of the workshop falls apart, hammers hit fingers, things knocked over, basically the whole workshop is trashed by the aftermath of simply moving the nails. Era - 80's or 90's, or at least that's when I remember seeing it. I would guess more like 80's. Any ideas? Ta

229762982	movie	extra	imdb	Name of a (I'm 99% sure) pre-code Hollywood film.

You can watch the clip I'm referring to here, https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G3btgSGYshE#t=297 and it should automatically play at 4:57. It's a clip of one male sailor asking another male sailor out on a date at an ice cream shop. I'm 99% sure this film is pre-code because it's black and white, and homosexuality this apparent in movies was not seen until the collapse of the code in the 1960s. Any help would be very greatly appreciated!

229791959	movie	extra	imdb	70's, 80's movie about two girls who skip camp, one's catholic. I've seen snippets of this movie on tv twice, so I know it exists and I'm reasonably sure it's a movie and not an episode of a TV series, though anything is possible. It involves two girls, one rich and about as white as it gets, and the other poor and who looks Italian, who attend the same summer camp, but it's NOT a camp hi-jinks movie. It's actually a drama (again, NOT a comedy) wherein the two girls form a strange friendship that involves them skipping camp and, in one scene at least, going to what I remember as an abandoned house or possibly a show-home, my memory is fuzzy, and pretending they're living there and eating dinner. In this scene, the differences in the girls' background become incredibly evident as the poor girl is pretending they're eating pizza or some other form of hand-food while the rich girl tells her no, they're having (some French-sounding food you eat with cutlery) all while addressing an imaginary butler she names ""Charles"". The poor girl gets fed up with this and with a snotty tone says ""Well I want a chocolate shake, CHARLES."" There is another scene at the rich girl's house where she tries, and fails, to talk about her day at camp with her family, making up a story so they won't know she skipped. Her little sister catches on, and later the girl goes to her sister's room and admits ""I skipped camp"". The sister says ""I know"" and she says ""I'm gonna do it again."" However, they get caught (not by their parents or camp authorities), and the poor girl gets a guilt attack and takes them to a confessional. The rich girl, who has no idea what to do, gets scared in the confessional and runs out to wait in the church. The poor girl freaks at the idea that the rich girl isn't catholic, and says ""You're gonna go to Hell!"" She's not angry at the girl, or threatening her; she's apparently genuinely scared that her friend will go to Hell, but the rich girl is dumb-founded. ""What, you mean just because I didn't tell about something we did?"" Because I can remember so many details, I'm quite certain that this exists and that I'm not just remembering wrong. However, I have looked up key words ""summer camp"" and ""rich girl poor girl"" on IMDb and nothing fits. The movie looks like it could have been shot in the 70's or 80's, and I'm fairly certain it was the VERY early 90's the first time I caught it on TV. Any ideas as to what this could be?

229808434	movie	extra	imdb	SOLVED - Rooftop, helicopter, ladder, pipe.. I have this recollection of a scene in a film, but cannot place it. It's daytime. A helicopter is taking off from a rooftop, I assume the villain was making his getaway. The hero (or heroine, but I seem to remember it being a man) grabs a metal link ladder that is hanging from the helicopter and pulls on it to try and prevent the helicopter taking off. He I'd dragged along the rooftop, which I thing was covered with pale-coloured gravel. There is a small pipe sticking out of the roof, and the hero hooks one of the rungs of the ladder under a bend in the end of this pipe, preventing the helicopter taking off. I think this was a 90s action movie, but it could be ten years either side. Any help would be greatly appreciated!
229812350	movie	extra	imdb	(Solved) 80's horror/mystery? Please help. Does anyone know what's the name of this movie? I'm pretty sure that it's made before the 90s, most likely b/w late 70s to late 80s. The movie started off with a writer/novelist moving into an abandoned/empty mansion in a remote area. He needed a quiet place to write his stuff. I think he settled in a room on the 2nd floor. Once he began to write/type out his story, he noticed something was wrong inside the mansion. So he walked out of the room and then there were supernatural/horror/mystery events happened to him. I don't remember the details and rest. But fast forward to the ending, it's revealed that the events happened right after he left the room were actually the stuff that he wrote. So nothing happened to him at all. Any clue?

229818321	movie	extra	imdb	After she went in coma,she woke up with amnesia.(Solved). I watched this movie in the early 90ies i think. It starts with a woman waking up in a hospital after a coma. She was unexpectedly calm. Her husband was convinced she was playing calm. Taking into his account what had happened before the coma, the husband realized that she was amnestic . So, he started to call off the divorce arrangements. He decided to set up their living house in a way that she may not relapse to her irritated behavior just like before their familial trauma. So he locked a certain room that could trigger back her memories and start over with her inflamed thoughts. She went back to live further in their house neatly and nicely without a fuss. Eventually the wife noted the locked room and the husband couldn't keep her away from going inside. Once inside, she saw the picture of her boy who died before her coma and started to recall those harsh events and memories. She started again what the husband was fearing all the time. She started to blame the death of their son on her husband . But she calmed down at the end and let that all thing pass. What is the name of this movie please ?!!! Thanks.
229833640	movie	extra	imdb	[SOLVED] In the days of sputnik, girls chase down runaway father-to-be. I have failed to recall the name of the movie in which three(?) teenage girls go out on the road to find the boyfriend of one of them. He is on his way to enlist in the army after his girlfriend told him that she's pregnant. The guy got the girl pregnant by telling her some story about sputnik and the end of the world. The movie takes place in 1957 or so. One of the girls has a boyfriend who rides on a motorcycle and his favourite quote is ""Don't crowd me"". The parents think the girls have been kidnapped and there is a scene in a forest where state troopers gun down two men (hunters) who are with the girls. It later turns out they were bankrobbers. In the end the girl finds out that she's not pregnant after all, but by then the boyfriend has already enlisted for the army.

229887323	movie	extra	imdb	(Solved)Looking for a movie title. Its American and was seemingly filmed in the early 2000's and has a somber, mysterious feel to it. It's about a single woman who lives in a house by herself and believes she is agoraphobic(phobia of the outside). The house always looks bright white and feels empty and sort of like a dream. I can't remember if she interacts with anyone else besides the people in her flash backs. The plot points to her having some fleeting memories of a child that she might have lost or might be imagining. There is a room that's locked for part of the movie but she is able to open it after a while. The ending insinuates that she is most likely has been in a mortal limbo and her agorophia is actually her inability to move on into either realm.

The poster had two men in an embrace, one had a Nazi armband. I think the plot may have had something to do with reincarnation.

229915414	movie	extra	imdb	[Solved] Can You Identify this Thriller/Action Movie?. Title: unknown Character's names: unknown Actor's names: unknown Release date: between mid 2000's & 2013 (no later). Probably towards the end of that range. Say...2010-2012 Plot elements: The main character had expertise in information security/cryptography and is a contract worker (I think a government contractor). The movie opens with him in an office building/lab working with his ""colleagues"" and I'm pretty sure he's an American working abroad. His task is to come up with a way to break a security algorithm presumably to test it's integrity and/or improve upon it. It's suggested that he has done this type of work before so he thinks this is all legit and sanctioned by the government agency (or company, not sure) in charge. He finishes the task and that is the end of his contract. A day or so later, he notices that he has not been paid (i think) but at any rate there was SOME discrepancy which leads him to contact the people who he thought he was working for, but they had no knowledge of any such job. He goes back to the office/lab where he was working to find out what's going on, and the building is empty. It turns out that his ""colleagues"", the building, etc. were all a setup designed to get him to believe he was working a legitimate contract. This deception was orchestrated by some criminal entity that wanted to steal a case containing something dangerous (which they did) but the case could not be safely opened without the access codes, which just so happen to use the same security algorithms that the main character was tasked with defeating... hence the elaborate deception. Also, I believe that for some portion of the movie, the main character had his daughter with him, but I might be wrong about that. Thanks.

229959514	movie	extra	imdb	Movie about a Box that can connect to the dead/spirits? (PLOT SPOILER). I'm looking for a movie that involved a family that moves into a home that was previously owned by a older couple (couple was probably in their 60s or 70s), of whom the husband was a psychologist and the mother was a pediatrician. As the family starts to settle into their new home, the (teenage) boy befriends a local girl who becomes his girlfriend. They discover this box in the house that was created to talk to the dead and take it up to the boys room, where the girl turns it on and winds it up, surprisingly to me she knew how to work the thing. They contact a spirit who seems to have an interest in them, and every time they play with the box it is the same spirit. So it turns out, that the spirit/ghost is that of the once mistress of the husband (older couple), who was gruesomely murdered by the wife in front of the husband for committing adultery and having an illegitimate 'love' child. Now this happened when the older couple were living in the home, before they sold it. There is a scene that shows the wife torturing the tied up woman in front of the husband as he holds their love child, ending with the wife slitting the woman's throat and dragging her into a smaller room inside of the boys room, where she is hid underneath the floor boards. The final scenes of the movie end with the girlfriend becoming possessed with the murdered woman's spirit/demon and killing the boy with hammer strikes to the head. The family comes home to find him dead and the girlfriend is taken away in police custody. Thanks for any help!

229981886	movie	extra	imdb	Can't figure out the name of this movie, but I really want to see it. In the early 00's, I was a younger boy and loved watching dramas with my dad. I remember it was a thriller/mystery about these people were dying of mysterious causes and it was all mirroring the deaths in the book. There is one part I clearly remember of the main character in a woman's library. He sees the book and the woman in the place dies. I believe the movie was on HBO around 1998-2001ish. If you could figure this out that would be great!
229985015	movie	extra	imdb	Name of old 'whodunnit' cartoon [SOLVED]. ""It was a dark and stormy night"" -- that's how it begins. Come to think of it, the beginning -- or the end, or both -- was not animated. I seem to recall Hitchcock being revealed as the murderer at the end, but I can't find any on the IMDb credits or Google searches. Bits and pieces I remember: -The murder and subsequent investigation takes place in a mansion. Don't think we got to see the actual murder. Or the body, for that matter. -At one point, the detective addresses the suspects around a table, demanding that when he turns off the light, the guilty party place the murder weapon on the table. He turns off the light, and when he turns the light back on there is a gigantic heap of all sorts of weapons on the table. -In his investigation throughout the mansion, he opens a closet and a body falls out. Then another, identical body. And then another. And another. And another. A whole lot of bodies fall out -- then one of the bodies freezes and addresses the camera, saying something like, ""Lots of us, ain't there?"" -The cartoon is at least as old as the early '80s, though if I'm right about Hitchcock, it could be no later than 1980.

Some ""adventurers"" show up to take the same trail out of town as those people supposedly had, to see what they can find. After a while, music is heard all around them, from no apparent source; creepy! I think they start turning on each other, but I kept getting interrupted while watching so am not sure.

230018894	movie	extra	imdb	Does anybody know this show?? SOLVED. Ok, so I was reading the synopsis for the Whispering Pines books by Blake Crouch and thought maybe it was the basis for a show I remember seeing sometime ago. I looked him up on here. His only credit is for the upcoming show of the same name. But it made start thinking more about that show and now I have to know what it was. So here is what I remember about it. People wake up in various locations around what seems to be a deserted town in the desert. I want to say there were between 12 to 20 of them, but maybe less. They are all strangers to each other. There is something preventing them from leaving the town but I can't recall if it a fence, some other physical barriers, warning signs, an invisible barrier, or some combination there of. I am pretty sure that one of them gets around the barrier, I think by digging a tunnel, only to be returned beaten half to death. I think he was dropped off and the people run out to see a van speeding away and try to stop it. There is also a general store where they can get supplies from a store keeper. They threaten to torture and/or kill the store clerk thinking he must have answers to how or why they are there only to be stopped by unseen forces. This is where the viewer comes to the revelation that they are being watched by these unseen people on monitors. I also want to say that they have some form of implant that causes abdominal pain, which is what stops them from killing the clerk and may be the unseen barrier. Through flash backs we start to see pieces of the stranger's pasts as they try to figure why they are there and who could have put them there. This is all I can remember. I am pretty sure I never saw the ending. Can't say for sure why. It may have been canceled. I am not even sure how long ago I saw it. I want to say it was before Lost but sometime during the 2000's but can't be sure. Anybody have an idea?? I may be remembering some of the details incorrectly so if you have an idea but it doesn't fit 100% let me know. If you have any other questions that my help pin point it, let'er rip. It's gonna bug me till I figure it out. ""Sit down, Podrick. We're going to need details. Copious details.""

230041538	movie	extra	imdb	Sinister cupboard with human-like handles(Solved). Hello, I saw this movie in the early 90ies (I guess). It is about an old cupboard. The handles of which are like female human hands carved from wood. When the cupboard is closed, its handles look like two human hands resting over a belly with the fingers overlapped. The cupboard can react with events and can open by its own will. In an occasion a woman was bounded to the evil nature of the cupboard.(If I am not mixing this movie with another, the woman went very evil and couldn't be harmed or killed. One person struggled to kill that woman inside the room, but he couldn't do her any harm regardless the direct hits on the woman's body. Accidentally, that person noted that if the mirror was scratched, then woman is readily harmed. When that person attempted to smash the mirror, the woman was alarmed by the cupboard to prevent their destruction). Anyone knows the name of that movie please !!! Thanks
230041661	movie	extra	imdb	Candid Camera Tv-Show (SOLVED). Hi! I was reminded of a pretty hilarious tv-show I saw when I was younger. I think it consisted of a guy, or a group of people doing silly ""background"" candid camera things. It's possible that the name of the show was the name of this one guy. These things were usually pretty short. Sometimes only a few seconds long, and often just consisted of walking around in stupid costumes on stupid places. I remember a few of the sketches: Two guys dressed up in fat suits walk into a cinema with their hands full of snacks. They walk through an entire row of seats, making a lot of people having to stand up or generally move out of their way until they sit down on the two free seats right next to the other side of the row. (Filmed from a car) A sign on a fenced in farm (I think) that says ""You don't have to be crazy to work here"" followed by another sign that says ""But it helps"" followed by a man dressed up in a full cow costume waving enthusiastically to the camera man. A guy walks up to a person sitting on stairs in front of a building and asks them for general directions. They point the way or otherwise exclaim they don't know. He walks two steps up, puts on a crude fake moustache and walks down, and asks the same person the same question again. He repeats this a few more times, and the person seems completely unaffected each time. Does this ring a bell to anyone?

230100144	movie	extra	imdb	A Trailer, Two Cartoons and a Song. I have a couple of things that I am wondering about. I will just list them and see if anyone knows what the hell I am talking about LOL. I remember seeing a recent movie trailer where everyone was chanting ogga chaka again and again like cavemen. It's just bugging me and I can't remember what that was from. I keep hoping that I will end up seeing the trailer again, but you know how it is when you are looking for something, you can never end up finding it. I remember two Warner Bros. cartoons from when I was younger that for some reason have stuck in my head but have no idea what they're called. The first one involves porky pig going fishing and I think he ends up naked on the bottom of the sea on some type of serving platter. That's all I can really remember about it. The other one involves this cartoon about this hat that nobody seems to want or that was in love with another hat, as ridiculous as that sounds. All I remember is that the hat blows away and gets trampled on a lot but then someone finds it cuts two holes it and puts it on top of a horse's head where the horse's ears or whatever fits through the holes in the hat. Then I think the hat is reunited with the other hat that it wanted to be with. The last one is much more vague. I was recently in the hospital and this guy was playing this song on the guitar that I thought was really nice but had no idea what it was called. The only thing I can remember is that he was singing something about how people would read the same dimestore novel twice in hopes that maybe the ending would be different. I was really delirious when I heard that, so I can't really remember any of the specific words, but it sounded like some type of hippie song and had a very nice tune to it. But that's all I remember. So does anyone have any ideas about this?

The first part that I remember had a little boy looking in the cupboard for a cup...and then he sees the dishwasher open and inside is a cup that has cartoon characters on it (or maybe muppets...I keep picturing Ernie and Bert from Sesame Street, but I'm not sure what characters were actually on the cup). The kid smiles and takes the cup out of the dishwasher to use. He may have talked with another person who came into the kitchen afterwards, but again, I'm not sure. Later, we see the kid sitting in a chair and a man (his dad maybe) walks by and doesn't even seem to notice him there. Later, his parents are talking and he goes up to them to try and get their attention. He tries talking to his mom, saying ""mom? MOM? Hey Mom!"" but she can neither see not hear him and goes on talking. Later, the kid is talking to a man who tells him that the reason his family can't see him is because he hasn't been born yet. It ends with a scene at the hospital delivery room, with a man (the same one from before?) coming out the door and telling the audience ""It's a boy."" Anyone know what movie or show this was from? Again, I saw it in the 80s, so it can't be any newer than that. Thanks for any help you can give me.
230131795	movie	extra	imdb	Need Help Identifying A 80's Witchcraft Film. So, there's this movie that I have made attempts at Googling to no avail. I saw it when I was a very young child in the late 80's, perhaps even the early 90's. I think I saw it on basic cable. The scant description I can provide is that it is a straight teenage drama that takes place in a rather suburban high school environment. The two primary characters are young women with supernatural abilities: One ""good girl witch"" and her counterpart/rival a ""bad girl bitch witch"". The only other plot detail I can recall is the movie ends (of course) with a big sequence of the ""bad girl"" witch being burned at the stake. Also, if my memory serves me correctly the production values were in the low to mid-grade level making me think it was probably a made for tv affair. I know the people on this board are super knowledgeable about even the most obscure titles and figured I would save myself further research. Thanks for any assistance.

230136743	movie	extra	imdb	Horror movie with wormy creature similar to Night/Creeps - Slither. ... remembering a movie I can't recall the title to; it was maybe from the mid 80's an independent lower budget movie to even Night of the Creeps It was one slithering alien [that spoke? psychically ?] to his host so it could feed on other people... the only scene I can recall more was one that creeped me out because it was in a communal shower: in the ""Sunshine Motel"" [in NYC I believe] the poor host chap goes there to clean up with the creature attached who slithers down his leg [he still had his towel on] and attacks a muscle bound tattooed dude who was using the shower at the same time When the creature fed he returned to the host and gave him endorphins/drugs [ i think] that made him feel good/addicted The movie was super low budget on par with ""Liquid Sky""

230163205	movie	extra	imdb	Movie title unknown (SOLVED). I saw this movie in the 70s, I think. A man is driving his car, in California? He sees a young woman looking for a ride and picks her up. She is a hippie and she is going to meet her friends in the same city where he lives. They start talking and get on well, even though the man is old enough to be her father. She tells him that she has never seen the ocean and he promises to take her there. On their way they see a wounded dog lying by the road. The girl wants to pick it up and bring it to the vet but the man refuses. The next day the man visits the girl and brings the dog with him; he had returned and picked it up and brought to the vet. The man and the girl become lovers, but the age difference makes it a bit awkward. He meets her friends and they are same age as his daughter; she meets his family (son/daugther?) and her future stepchild is about her own age. The lovers split but can´t be apart so they decide to stay together as long as they both want to. Does anyone remember this film? Thanks in advance.

230206116	movie	extra	imdb	(SOLVED) Movie where a kid must rescue his dog from a gang. This was a movie I saw back in the 80s where a kid's dog gets taken by some punks and he and his friends have to go rescue the dog. I think the kid has an older mentor figure who gives him his dog tags from the military before he goes off to save the dog. Also, before he goes, the kid stops to visit the grave of his first dog, who was hit by a car. They get to a junkyard where the punks are and see the dog, but it has turned mean and barks and snarls at the kid. I don't remember much of what happened after that, but I think they do finally rescue the dog and at the end, the boy gives the man his dog tags back and the dog has puppies. Does this sound familiar to anyone? Again, it has to be from the 80s or older. Thanks for any help you can give me.

There's a man investigating deaths in a village, a young girl may have psychic powers on a reality tv show documentary, a strange village that has weird worship practices (which might have been flooded to create a lake or dam?). There's a scene near the end of the movie which shows a man trying to find someone in the woods and stumbling across a bunch of creepy ghost babies crawling towards a girl. And there's also a young man with mental disabilities that somehow ties into all of it. Really scatterbrained, but if anyone has any ideas it would be greatly appreciated!

One scene popped into my head but I can’t I.D. the film. I’m almost sure it was Tony Curtis in the scene but can’t find the right title in his filmography. It is a comedy, probably from the late 1960s. Curtis (as I believe) has been captured by spies who think he is a spy (but he’s not). They shoot him full of truth serum and question him about U.S. infrastructure. All drugged up, Curtis can’t answer anything until they ask him about bridges. He slurs that he knows about a bridge. Where? they ask. Curtis puts a finger in his mouth and says, “Right here.” Hilarity ensues. Any help is greatly appreciated. Thanks in advance. mf I've never been anyplace I want to go back to.

230269052	movie	extra	imdb	Impending Disaster Movie with dream warnings.. I'm trying to remember a great film I saw some time ago about an American family with one girl child with a mental handicap. Set in tornado alley. The father was having these reoccurring nightmares. The first was when his dog bit him - in the dream. Another dream was dead birds falling out of the sky and another was when the rain turned to brown. He thought he was going mad and so did his wife. He went to a psychiatrist for help. He worked in plant hire and he borrowed a digger and dug a huge hole in his garden and bought a huge metal container to put in it. He constructed a storm shelter but he didn't know why. His dreams were telling him a great disaster was coming and he tried to warn his community but they thought he was mad.He was sacked from his job for borrowing the digger. He gave his dog to his brother for safe keeping. On the advice of his doctor he and his wife and daughter went to the coast for a holiday and stayed at a beach front house. The father took his daughter to make sand castles and she looked out to sea and then so did the father. What he saw out at sea far away was at least five tornadoes and a huge tsunami coming their way. The sea was receding far out before the big waves were coming to shore. Right at the end of this film you realized what all the dreams were about. That this man was being warned somehow about the disaster coming by his dreams. At the end even his wife realized that her husband had been warned to prepare for disaster and that he wasn't mad at all. Trouble was they still had to get back to their home and the storm shelter which had food and water ready in it as well as oxygen for the daughter. You were left wondering if they made it back home in time. A very suspenseful film. Low key but the buildup to the end was very well done. What is the title of this film? Can anyone tell me?

230285099	movie	extra	imdb	[SOLVED] Movie (late 80s or early 90s) with blond lesbian character?. Looking for the name of a movie I once saw on cable that's probably from the late 80s or early 90s. I think that the lead actress was played by Ellen Barkin, but I just looked at her filmography and nothing rings a bell. So, it may have been someone else. I have a vague memory of a scene where the lead actress meets a feminine woman with long blond hair (curly hair?) who happens to be a lesbian. The lesbian was sitting behind a desk. Then in another scene, I think they went out on a date together. Then they were about to have sex. The lesbian was trying to take off the lead actress' dress but she couldn't get it off, so the lead actress said something like ""It's a body suit"" (meaning that it had buttons in the crotch area). The lead actress wasn't a lesbian but was only trying to get some kind of information out of the lesbian. Anyone know what movie this is?

It sounded like this guy was African American. It was NOT Family Matters or Kenan and Kel or My Brother and Me. It was an adult show, and plus, K&K didn't air until 1996. And I could tell it was a sitcom because there was audience laughter in the background. Does this quote sound familiar? And the show had to be a rerun of something because it was summer. Like the proverbial cheese, I stand alone. Even while seated.
230318820	movie	extra	imdb	I'm looking for a title of a movie.. I remember watching a movie on HBO back in the early 1980's, and I can't remember the title to it, or any of the actors in it. Maybe someone can help me find it. The plot: There's a contest where a contestant goes into a bubble with a lot of money blowing around in it. the contestant has a certain amount of time to grab as much money as possible. A group of girls (3 I believe, I don't remember the exact number) come up with the plan to steal the money out of the bubble. They take a vacuum and suck the money out while the contest is going on. To distract the security while 2 of the girls are stealing the money, one of the girls is undressing on a stage. She undresses down to her bra and panties, and then removes her bra and shows her bare breasts to the audience. That's all I remember about it, if anyone knows the title of it, I'd greatly appreciate your help.

The people at the reception area thought the screams were from a dental patient being hurt. I think the movie was from the 80s.

230354762	movie	extra	imdb	Six part BBC Childrens TV series: Alien teen on earth (Solved). This was a six part series, or a short series, so maybe based on a book. An alien male teen is sent to earth as part of a coming-of-age trial. He's told to avoid bad aliens and look for something called the 'behemoth'. At the end he's told There's no bad aliens, that was part of the test The only other part I remember is him approaching a group of teens listening to a boom-box and asking them if it's 'behemoth'. They say something like, 'Nah, mate, it's Nirvana'. 80s, I think. Thanks in advance!
230365358	movie	extra	imdb	Solved! - Young Girl in Early 1900s/Dungarees. I can't remember what this movie is, and it is bugging the heck out of me! I think it was set sometime in the early 1900s (probably between 1900-1920). There was a little girl (between 9 and 11) who I think was sort of a tomboy. I believe her mom was dead and so her dad was bringing her up (and she possibly had a little brother?) I remember a scene of her getting on board a train to go live with her aunt or something, who was going to help her become a ""lady"". At the train station, I remember them pinning a nametag onto her coat that had her information in case she got lost. I remember the aunt getting mad at the girl for wearing overalls or jeans (they called them ""dungarees"") and I think maybe she hid them at some point? Also, there was a fire at the neighbor's house at some point, and I think the girl saved someone by climbing a tree to their window or something. Sorry it's kind of a lot of info, but hopefully someone will know! I think it came out between 2004 & 2008. I get the feeling that it had the girl's name in the title, but it wasn't the whole title (like maybe ""The ____ of Girl's Name""). Thanks in advance!
230366488	movie	extra	imdb	TV movie about doctor in WWI SOLVED. In the early 90's, my biology teacher showed us a TV movie about an American doctor during WWI. I assume it was science related but I don't remember the plot. All I remember that is that the doctor was white with glasses and he had a girlfriend who may have been a nurse. The actor kinda looked like Josh Charles but it wasn't him. I'm pretty sure that it was on PBS. I thought maybe it was an episode of ""Masterpiece Theater"" but the star was American. My guess is that is was about the early life of a renowned scientist. George Carlin: It's all bullsh-t and it's bad for ya.

It seems like a horror/thriller movie that takes place inside a radio station in a rural area in Canada. There is a middle aged man named Grant and two young women named Sidney and Laurel-Ann. It seems like people outside are becoming cannibals, there is one reporter named Kenny Loni and there's a snowstorm. Probably made in the last 15 years or so. Anybody recognise this?
230378512	movie	extra	imdb	Name of 90's TV movie. This TV movie is at least 15 yrs old. It's about a mentally challenged woman. I thought it was Jean Smart from Designing Women but I didn't find it in her filmography. I can remember the story, only how it made me feel. I cried ALOT! I think she had a child and it was taken from her by some child protection agency. I know I'm not giving much to go on but I've been trying to find this movie for years!
230378530	movie	extra	imdb	SOLVED: movie title: drama about mentally ill woman who is pregnant?. Hi all, Years ago I remember seeing a trailer for a film that I intended to see, but I forgot the title before I watched it and have never managed to track it down again. I'm hoping someone can help me figure it out. Here's what I recall: Main plot: A young woman is diagnosed with a major mental illness, such as schizophrenia. I believe she may have been hospitalized at times because of this. Maybe at the start of the film, she has managed to gain a bit of stability using prescription medication. She meets a young man and they fall passionately in love. They want so badly to have a ""normal"" life and family. Either she gets pregnant unexpectedly, or they PLAN to have a baby, and she is absolutely thrilled. However, because of the pregnancy, she is forced to stop taking her meds (because they would harm the child), which causes her to become severely psychotic. She either has the baby taken from her by the authorities or she is forced to fight with everything she has to prove that she can care for the child, because the authorities believe she is a danger to the child. I believe the story was told in a very dramatic manner and was very sad because they loved each other and the child so much and tried so hard to do what is best for the child. Other relevant facts: The movie was in color and I *think* the actors spoke English (though I'm not positive about that, because I do watch a lot of foreign films with subtitles). I believe I saw the trailer sometime between 1996 - 2004. At the time that I saw the trailer, I think it was already out on video. The film did not seem outdated to me, so I believe it was probably made no earlier than 1985, but probably more like a mid-to-late 90's or even early 2000's. When I try to remember the title or main actors, I always come back to the movie Crazy/Beautiful with Kirsten Dunst (although I am positive it is NOT that film). Not sure if the name of my film was similar, if it came out at approximately the same time as Crazy/Beautiful, or if the main actress reminded me of Dunst...or maybe there is no good reason for me to think of Crazy/Beautiful at all. Does anyone have any suggestions??? Thanks in advance!

230391455	movie	extra	imdb	Name of these 2 movies?. 1. I think it's a late 90s / early 2000's teen horror film. I believe the beginning has a couple kids who have been drinking and they go to a lake/sewage dump at night. They dare one of the kids to jump in and he dies or gets hurt. 2. Can't really provide many details on the film. I was 8 or around there when I briefly saw a clip that my parents were watching. My only memory is of a guy naked on operating table type thing. Then I think aliens covered him in plastic or something and put jelly around his mouth (or what I perceived to be jelly). I think the background was all white along with the table. Maybe he was sleeping and got abducted/it was a dream at night. Sorry, if they're vague or easy films.

230400854	movie	extra	imdb	Green goo in a jar. The film wouldn't have been made later than the 70s. It was probably the mid 70s or earlier. Might have been a made-for-TV movie. I know I watched it on TV at any rate. Probably was a horror film or a thriller, though it's possible it was SciFi. All I remember was that there was a jar of some sort of green goo or green-colored liquid, glowing if I remember correctly, that was on a shelf in either in a detached garage or possibly a cellar or basement. I'm picturing a white or light-colored detached garage, probably with wood siding, but I'm not very confident re this part--I could be combining memories. I know it was a green jar of stuff in either a detached garage or a cellar/basement though. http://rateyourmusic.com/~JrnlofEddieDeezenStudies

230474488	movie	extra	imdb	Movie about a troubled teenage girl (solved). I am looking for the title of a movie about a troubled teenage girl, who happens to be Native-American/First Nations. The cultural background plays a role, but is not really important for the main story. The mother takes the girl to her parents, hoping they can help sort her out. She might also need a place for the daughter because of her work and travel. The girl has no interest in either mother or grandparents. She only wants to 'work' her mobile and listen to her iPod (or maybe CD player?). She gets along well with her mother's sister and gradually the grandfather gets through to her and they start bonding. She then discovers that a childhood friend she used to dream about was in fact her (twin?) brother. He had some type of mental disability, which her mother feared would get her hurt at some point, so she leaves with the girl and the boy stays behind with the grandparents. There is no father involved. The grandparents have given up on the boy, as he started doing drugs and stealing and finally ran away, but the girl does meet him by chance. Before they can bond he gets killed while burgling someone and she is devastated. At first I think she blames her mother and grandparents, but in the end I think she goes home to/with her mother. After watching the movie I wanted to find out about the actors and for most of them this was the only title in their info. That makes it hard to use lists like 'native-American actors' now that I can't remember the title. Neither does looking up 'native-American films' help, since this one is not about a native-American topic, like those on such a list. It just happens to be the background of a more general type of drama. I had watched it last year on Netflix, found it by chance as a recommendation after watching another film. That film is still there, but it does not point to the one I am looking for anymore and I think Netflix removed 'my' film. Thanks for helping me out!
