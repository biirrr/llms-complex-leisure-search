**Explanation:**

This list is compiled based on the provided description and my knowledge of children's books. It's important to note that the description lacks precise details, making it difficult to pinpoint a specific book. I've included books that share some similarities with the description, such as:

* **Themes:** Family, feelings, and adventures are common themes in many children's books, especially those targeted towards early readers.
* **Visual Style:**  The description suggests photographic illustrations with a 1970s feel. While many children's books feature illustrations rather than photographs, some books published during that era, or those aimed at teaching basic concepts, might use photographs. 
* **Specific Details:** The details about the girl's appearance and the suitcase are very vague, making it difficult to narrow down the options further.

**Confidence Scores:**

The confidence scores reflect how likely I think the suggestion is the correct answer. They are based on the overall fit of the book to the description and my knowledge of children's literature. The scores are very low as the description is quite general, and many books could potentially fit some of the details. 

**Important Note:** The user should be aware that the provided information is limited, and finding the exact book may be challenging without more specific details. Further information, such as the publisher, any characters' names, or the book's cover design, would be helpful to narrow down the options.
